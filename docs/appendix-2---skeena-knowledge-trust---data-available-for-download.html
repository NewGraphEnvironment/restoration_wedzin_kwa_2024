The goal of the Bulkley River Bank Stabilization and Riparian Rehabilitation Project was to re-establish a stand of native riparian zone plants immediately adjacent to the Bulkley River. The site for treatment was a (650m) strip of exposed and eroding riverbank along the Bulkley River. The project took place on a privately owned property. The land at the site was originally cleared for the rail town of Hubert in the early 1900's. The land eventually became grazing land and has been maintained for agricultural purposes till the present day. In recent years extensive erosion has taken place at this site. Alternative methods to classic riverbank armoring with rock were desirable due to the legal ramifications involved with the possible negative downstream effects of armoring. Furthermore, the costs for armoring would have been considerably higher than the costs involved with bioengineering (river bank stabilization). ","Richfield Creek was included in a larger riparian restoration initiative in 2021 through the Morice Water Monitoring Trust (see dataset: Upper Bulkley Riparian Restoration).

Habitat complexity was improved through the creation of undercut banks and the addition of large woody debris to provide more adult cover and holding habitat.","In 2006, Gitksan Watershed Authorities was retained by the Pacific Salmon Commission to conduct an effectiveness monitoring in three Mid Skeena sub-basins: the Kispiox, Kitseguecla, and the Suskwa. This watershed restoration effectiveness monitoring assessment is part of a larger regional effort to ensure treatment designs and their applications are effective, and if not, provide technical feedback to refine designs. As well, the evaluations will rate the extent of watershed recovery achieved and help to ensure funds are spent on the most cost-effective treatments.","Water Quality Effectiveness Evaluations arose out of the Forest and Range Practices Act as a way of measuring the effectiveness of the Act in accomplishing its forest stewardship objectives. The field procedure for Water Quality Effectiveness Evaluation (WQEE, Carson et al, 2007) is accepted as a standard methodology by the Forest Investment Account for the Land Base Investment Program (Zapisocki, 2008).\r\n\r\nThe evaluation methods described the field guide were designed such that an efficient evaluation may be conducted effectively by non‐specialists. Using the measurements of the sites road, drainage\r\nstructure and bank contributions to sediment transport and supply, the site can be categorized into low, moderate, high, very high and extreme classifications for impacts (Zapisocki, 2008).","Link to the Upper Bulkley restoration sites map on the Skeena Maps Portal.

It identifies management zones, suggests zone-specific treatment options with the potential to maintain or restore important values to watersheds and landscapes and proposes a pathway for implementation.\r\n","This document is meant to be used by practitioners to aid in prescribing or carrying out silviculture treatments in riparian areas.","This report is the initial survey of the impacted areas within the Mid-Bulkley Watershed and denotes the nature of the impact from past timber harvesting and road building practices. ","An overview fish and fish habitat assessment in the sub-basins of the Mid-Bulkley Watershed that: determines what fish species are at risk to the impacts of poor land-use practices in the watershed; identifies areas of concern that need to be examined in quantitative field surveys of fish habitat; identifies preliminary restoration strategies; and where appropriate, identifies preliminary restoration opportunities.","The Fish Habitat and Assessment Procedure (FHAP) is a means of assessing watersheds with a history of anthropogenic activity for impacts to fish and fish habitats using a set of integrated physical and biological indicators. For each area in the Mid-Bulkley watershed, land use assessments, riparian assessments, channel assessments, fish and fish habitat assessments, impact synopses, and restrictions and recommendations for habitat improvement are delivered. The purpose of this plan is to guide sub-basin restoration priorities and timing, and to integrate individual restoration prescriptions with overall watershed-level goals.","The following report presents the Interim Restoration Plans (IRP) for targeted watershed units (WU) within the Morice Forest District. The layout of this Interim Restoration Plan has been broken down by watershed unit. For each watershed unit, a brief overview description is given first. Next, an overview satellite image shows all of the development within the watershed unit up to June 2000. Sub-unit summaries follow the satellite images. The sub-unit summaries outline works completed, fisheries values, watershed type, riparian condition, hill sloped and gully condition, channel/fish habitat condition, and road condition. After the sub-unit summaries, the benefits of restoration activities on fish habitat are outlined. Finally, the interim restoration goals for the watershed unit are given. ","The Habitat Restoration and Salmon Enhancement Program (HRSEP) was established in 1996/97 to complement the Pacific Salmon Revitalization Strategy.

We assessed 146 mapped road crossings for sedimentation risk in the Ironside, Cullon and Lower Kispiox sub-basins of the Kispiox River Watershed in northwest British Columbia. The Water Quality Effectiveness Evaluation was used at each crossing, as developed by Carson et al. (2008), which ranks each crossing and gives it a Total Crossing Score. Using 1:50,000 scale maps, we estimated there to be 350 crossings in the study area; therefore approximately 42% of the total were surveyed in 2008. Of the 146 mapped crossings in these sub-basins that we attempted to locate, the breakdown of sediment risk rankings was Very High (5.5% - n=8), High (13.7% - n=20), Moderate (29.5% - n =43), Low (16.4% - n=24), Very Low (34.2% - n=50) and 1 mapped crossing was not found. Preliminary prescriptions were developed for 56 crossings with an estimated budget of $660,000. Recommendations were made on another 5 crossings to mitigate beaver related problems, and maintenance issues were noted at 3 others. It is also recommended the remaining crossings are surveyed as soon as possible, at an estimated cost of $40,000.","This second summary document provides information (pH, alkalinity, calcium, and sensitivity rating) for about 760 lakes sampled between 1977 and 1986.

Monthly water chemistry monitoring of the Upper Bulkley and tributaries was conducted between November 1997 and March 2000, and the end of growing season accumulation of benthic algae, or periphyton, was measured at nine sites in September 1999. A summary of the results indicated the Upper Bulkley watershed has elevated background phosphorous concentrations due to the presence of phosphorous-rich soils that contribute unusually high total and soluble phosphorous concentrations to watercourses, exacerbated by sedimentation sources related to mining, forestry, and agriculture. As a result, thick accumulations of benthic algae are seen at some sites in the lower watershed, accompanied by a shift in community composition toward mesotrophic or eutrophic taxa.","This study focused on the diffuse sources of nutrients and the trophic status of the Upper Bulkley River.

Low channel complexity, removal of riparian vegetation, culvert obstructions to fish passage, sedimentation, altered flow regime, and channelization were some of the major and widespread impacts identified during the assessment of the lower 2918m of Dahlie Creek conducted in the fall of 1999. Significant alterations in the drainage pattern of Dahlie Creek, particularly in reach 3 upstream of the CNR tracks have been identified. Future developments are proposed for the lower three reaches of Dahlie Creek.","Designated water uses for Smithers Lakes included drinking, recreation, aquatic life, irrigation, livestock and industrial use. Water quality objectives were set in 1985 to protect these designated uses, and this report summarizes levels of attainment in 2001 and 2002/03, and provides recommendations for updating objectives. ","Designated water uses for Lakelse Lake include raw drinking water supplies, primary-contact recreation, and aquatic and wildlife use. Water quality objectives set to protect the lake for these designated uses include: fecal coliform concentrations at beaches and water intakes, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, total phosphorus, and chlorophyll a.
