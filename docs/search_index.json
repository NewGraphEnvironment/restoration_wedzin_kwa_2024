The Wet’suwet’en people are a matrilineal society organized into the Gilseyhu (Big Frog), Laksilyu (Small Frog), Tsayu (Beaver clan), Gitdumden (Wolf/Bear) and Laksamshu (Fireweed) clans. Within each of the clans there are are a number of kin-based groups known as Yikhs or House groups. The Yikh is a partnership between the people and the territory. Thirteen Yikhs with Hereditary Chiefs manage a total of 38 distinct territories upon which they have jurisdiction. Within a clan, the head Chief is entrusted with the stewardship of the House territory to ensure the Land is managed in a sustainable manner. Inuk Nu’at’en (Wet’suwet’en law) governing the harvesting of fish within their lands are based on values founded on thousands of years of social, subsistence and environmental dynamics. The Yintahk (Land) is the centre of life as well as culture and it’s management is intended to provide security for sustaining salmon, wildlife, and natural foods to ensure the health and well-being of the Wet’suwet’en (Office of the Wet’suwet’en 2013; “Office of the Wet’suwet’en” 2021; FLNRORD 2017). There are a total of six first nation bands that encompass the Wet’suwet’en. These are: Wet’suwet’en, Ts’il Kaz Koh, Hagwilget Village, Nee-Tahi-Buhn Band, Skin Tyee and Witset (“Wetʼsuwetʼen” 2022). 1.2 Widzin Kwah Water Sustainability Project The Widzin Kwah Water Sustainability Project is a joint initiative led by the Office of the Wet’suwet’en and Province of BC, as two governments working together with the goal to develop and recommend for approval new objectives and management direction for the Widzin Kwah. What is known to the Wet’suwet’en as Widzin Kwah is the river called Morice, and means river of clear, blue-green waters. Widzin Kwah includes its starting place where the river flows from its headwaters at Morice Lake (Widzin Bin), to where it meets and joins the Upper Bulkley River (Neexdzii Kwah) and continues as Widzin Kwah until its confluence with the Skeena River near Hazelton BC. The purpose of the Widzin Kwah Water Sustainability Project is for maintaining and improving watershed health (condition) and integrity (function) (“Widzin Kwah Water Sustainability Project” n.d.). 1.3 Widzin Kwah The common english nameing conventions for the Bukley River and Morice Rivers can be confusing since the Neexdzii Kwah (Upper Bulkley River) is actually a tributary to Widzin Kwah (Morice River) providing on average less than a third of it’s flow volumes where it flows in to the much larger system at Houston, BC. Historic nameing of the rivers during colonization resulted in “Bulkley River” being the name chosen for the mainstem of the system flowing from Houston to the confluence with the Skeena River at Hazelton - however - a more accurate colonial name for the system may have been the Morice River with the Upper Bulkley River considered a tributary of another namesake. It is important to recognize that the interpretation of the English names for the Bulkley River, the Upper Bulkley River and the Morice River can misrepresent the reality of flow patterns in the greater watersheds and that by using Wet’suwet’en place names we not only acknowledge the deep connection Wet’suwet’en carry to their clan territories, but also communicate a more accurate interpretation of the geography of the region. More detail regarding the hydrology and fisheries of the Widzin Kwa and the Neexdzii Kwah will be provided in the background section of this document. 1.4 Project Scope 1.4.1 Historic and Ongoing Ecosystem Degradation The Neexdzii Kwah (Upper Bulkley River) has been noted as containing some of the most intense land use in the Skeena Basin predominantly in the form of agriculture, linear development, and forest development activities. Logging, farming, transportation infrastructure, and mining have altered drainage, vegetation and soil properties, leading to changes in water, sediment, and nutrient transportion throughout the watershed. Activities in riparian areas adjacent to rivers and streams, such as deforestation or development, have changed how much sunlight hits the water, impacted the flow of large debris and organic matter, and altered natural river dynamics, including the stability of banks and channels, sediment movement, water flow throughout the seasons, and how floods occur. Cutting off streams from their surrounding floodplains has further disrupted water cycles, nutrient distribution, and the types of plants growing there. Additionally, human actions like the extensive fishing of salmon, as well as the introduction of hatchery salmon, have likely significantly altered salmon population structure to outside of the historic range of variability present pre-colonialization (A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett 2007). Changes to the climate systems are causing impacts to natural and human systems on all continents with alterations to hydrological systems caused by changing precipitation or melting snow and ice increasing the frequency and magnitude of extreme events such as floods and droughts (Climate Change 2014: Synthesis Report. Geneva, Switzerland: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). 2014; ECCC 2016). These changes are resulting in modifications to the quantity and quality of water resources throughout British Columbia and are likely to compound issues related to drought and flooding in the study area where numerous water licenses are held with a potential over-allocation of flows identified during low flow periods (ILMB 2007). 1.4.2 Project Objectives In partnership with the Morice Water Monitoring Trust, A Rocha, Office of Wet’suwet’en, Fisheries and Oceans Canada and representatives of the Provincial government (all members of the Upper Bulkley Round Table) - low-tech, process-based, watershed restoration activities will be implemented to build upon previous work in the region. Project team members will engage with local land users, land owners and industrial users of the land to collaboratively understand and communicate drivers of ecosystem degradation in the region as well as to work together to stop the degradation while implementing actions intended to improve watershed health. To collaboratively understand the outcomes of past restoration efforts in areas of historic importance to salmon and ecosystem function the following are required: amalgamation and sharing of information regarding past prescriptive restoration actions in the region that may or may not have been implemented, amalgamation of information about past restoration sites, including descriptions of what work was completed, who the land owner was, results of past/current monitoring and what kind of monitoring and maintenance activities may be appropriate in the future, To collaboratively stop the drivers of watershed health degradation and set the stage for actions that can meaningfully improve watershed health - the following are required: identification of overlap between current and historically important fish habitat where riparian vegetation has been removed or degraded and where it may be most effective to restore or protect riparian vegetation to improve habitat values, water quality and quantity, identification of areas where stream channels/floodplain has been altered (ie. channel relocation/straightening, dredging, sediment blockages, etc.) and where it may be important to restore or protect channel morphology to improve fish habitat, water quality and quantity, identification and details of potential barriers to fish passage and subsequent fish passage restoration options, identification of landowners who are interested in participating in conservation and restoration - as well as monitoring and maintenance activities, identification of parcels of land that coincide with potentially high value aquatic habitats or areas that have the potential to significantly impact high value aquatic habitats that are publicly owned and can be accessed by all without restriction or permission, and identification of potential funding sources for restoration activities and monitoring and maintenance activities that can help maintain stability for a comprehensive program that allows the resources and time necessary to conduct a robust restoration implementation and monitoring program with a scale suitable to address the magnitude of the issues at hand. Physical actions indented to facilitate watershed health improvements can include but are not limited to: rebuilding of riparian structure through cattle exclusion and planting/seeding/maintenance of native vegetation, reconnection of streams to their floodplains disconnected by stream channel incision, historic channel dredgeing, stream realignment, the CN Railway, Highway 16 and other linear transportation infrastructure, remediation of fish passage at potential barriers for migrating adult and juvenile salmon, stabilization of streambanks to prevent erosion, sediment deposition and the loss of riparian vegetation, and mimicking and promoting beaver activity on the landscape to encourage retention of water on the floodplains that will result in the slow release of surface water and recharging of groundwater. Planning and physical actions may require a high degree of outreach and collaboration with interest holders and regulators while prioritizing process-based approaches to restoration which rely on assisting natural river corridor processes over time whenever possible. Effectiveness monitoring and adaptive management will be important components of the work to ensure knowledge is gained through the restoration processes while being carried forward and shared widely to inform future investments. The purpose of this document is to outline watershed restoration initiatives which can be actionable in the future. 1.4.3 Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) As we move forward with watershed recovery efforts, Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) will play a crucial role for understanding and managing ecosystems in the Neexdzi Kwah watershed. Recognized by research such as Ignace (2000) and Casi (2021), TEK is wisdom passed down through generations, highlighting sustainable ways to live in harmony with nature. Integrating this knowledge into this initiative will enrich scientific approaches and help ensure that recovery strategies developed are rooted in the history and culture of the local communities. Recovery processes can take decades and even centuries and engaging actively with local communities will be key to successful outcomes. It is hoped that activities related to this initiative can highlight the value of TEK while producing tangible benefits for local communities. Education will play a pivotal role to understand the importance of TEK - fostering a mutual respect that can lead to innovative solutions to environmental challenges. An inclusive approach will lead to recovery processes that are not only effective but also equitable, honoring the wisdom and rights of those who have been guardians of Neexdzi Kwah lands for millennia. path_fig &lt;- &quot;fig/background/&quot; fs::dir_create(path_fig) knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.path = path_fig, dev = &quot;png&quot;) "],["background.html", "2 Background 2.1 Project Location 2.2 Skeena Knowledge Trust 2.3 Water Quality 2.4 Fisheries 2.5 Restoration Philosophy", " 2 Background 2.1 Project Location The study area primarily focuses on the Neexdzii Kwah (Upper Bulkley River), which is located upstream of the confluence of the Widzin Kwah (Morice River) and the Neexdzii Kwah rivers.

The Morice River is an 8th order stream that flows approximatley 80km from Widzin Bin (Morice Lake) to the confluence with the upper Bulkley River just north of Houston. Major tributaries include the Nanika River, the Atna River, Gosnell Creek and the Thautil River. There area numerous large lakes situated on the south side of the watershed including Morice Lake, McBride Lake, Stepp Lake, Nanika Lake, Kid Price Lake, Owen Lake and others. There is one active hydrometric station on the mainstem of the Morice River near the outlet of Morice Lake and one historic station that was located at the mouth of the river near Houston that gathered data in 1971 only [@canada2010NationalWater]. An estimate of mean annual discharge for the one year of data available for the Morice near it&#39;s confluence with the Bulkley River is `r round(fasstr::calc_longterm_mean(station_number = &quot;08ED003&quot;)$LTMAD,1)` m^3^/s. Mean annual discharge is estimated at `r round(fasstr::calc_longterm_mean(station_number = &quot;08ED002&quot;)$LTMAD,1)` m^3^/s at station 08ED002 located near the outlet of Morice Lake. Flow patterns are typical of high elevation watersheds influenced by coastal weather patterns which receive large amounts of winter precipitation as snow in the winter and large precipitation events in the fall. This leads to peak levels of discharge during snowmelt, typically from May to July with isolated high flows related to rain and rain on snow events common in the fall (Figures \\@ref(fig:hydrograph4) - \\@ref(fig:hydrology-stats4)). # # ```{r, eval=TRUE} # lfpr_create_hydrograph(&quot;08ED002&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08ED002.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrology_stats_08ED002.png&quot;) 2.1.3 Climate Anomalies To provide regional climate context, we used a custom fork of the BC Climate Anomaly App to generate precipitation, mean temperature, and soil moisture anomaly plots for the study area (BC Government 2024). This version of the app - located here allows for custom spatial inputs, enabling localized summaries served through the app locally. Anomalies are calculated relative to 1981–2010 climate normals using ERA5-Land reanalysis data, regridded to ~30 km spatial resolution (@ Muñoz Sabater 2019). Trend direction and significance are assessed using the Mann-Kendall test and Theil-Sen slope estimator over the 1951–present period (BC Government 2024). See Appendix 1 - Climate Anomaly Data for plots. 2.2 Skeena Knowledge Trust The Skeena Knowledge Trust (SKT) serves as a centralized repository for data and information related to salmon and salmon habitat within the Skeena River watershed. To support informed decision-making, SKT provides access to a wide range of reports, datasets, and spatial information through its online platform. A summary of the available project packages and geospatial data can be found in Appendix 2, which provides an overview of key resources and their relevance to salmon conservation and habitat management in the region. 2.3 Water Quality Water quality in the Neexdzi Kwah watershed has been the focus of multiple key studies, including among others - Nijman (1996), Remington and Donas (2000), Oliver (2020) and Westcott (2022b). The background information and resulting recommendations contained within these reports are critical for informing watershed recovery actions, as water quality has the potential to be a limiting factor for fish and fish food. This detailed documentation can also be leveraged to serve as a baseline dataset in which to compare current and future conditions. The reader is encouraged to source information directly from the aforementioned reports as the following summary has been simplified greatly. The technical report by Nijman (1996) assessed the water quality of the Bulkley River headwaters, focusing on the impacts of the Equity mine, using available data on waste discharges, water quality, streamflows, and water use. It also identified water uses requiring protection and recommended provisional water quality objectives for the headwaters and downstream sections. Remington and Donas (2000) put together the analysis of a significant amount of technical data related water, sediment and periphyton samples collected from November 1997 to March 2000 by the Habitat Restoration and Salmonid Enhancement Program (Fisheries and Oceans Canada) and others. Nutrients monitored included total phosphorus (TP), soluble orthophosphorus (SRP), ammonia, nitrate, organic nitrogen and total dissolved nitrogen. Periphytic algae was measured at nine sites September 1999 by Remington Enviromnental. Substrate composition and interstitial dissolved oxygen measurement was also conducted at three sites in the upper Bulkley River mainstem as well as one site within Maxan Creek. Reporting from the project noted that the Neexdzi Kwah watershed has easily erodible glacial-fluvial and glacial-lacustrine soils and unusually high soluble phosphorus concentrations compared to other Skeena watershed streams, making it particularly vulnerable to eutrophication from nitrogen loading linked to septic, agriculture and livestock. They recommended a long-term, cost-effective ecosystem health monitoring strategy, incorporating water quality, periphyton, and benthic invertebrate bioassessment. Monitoring nutrients and algae was highlighted as a key approach to track changes over time, assess restoration success, and identify long-term trends within the upper Bulkley River mainstem and major tributaries to better target remedial actions. 2.4 Fisheries 2.4.1 Neexdzii Kwah Traditionally, the salmon stocks passing through and spawning in the greater Bulkley River were the principal food source for the Gitxsan and Wet’suwet’en people living there (Wilson and Rabnett 2007). Anadromous lamprey passing through and spawning in the upper Neexdzii Kwah were traditionally also an important food source for the Wet’suwet’en (A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett (2007); pers comm. Mike Ridsdale, Environmental Assessment Coordinator, Office of the Wet’suwet’en). A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett (2007) report sourceing information from Department of Fisheries and Oceans (1991) that principal spawning areas for chinook in the Neexdzii Kwah include the mainstem above and below Buck and McQuarrie Creeks, between Cesford and Watson Creeks, and the reaches upstream and downstream of Bulkley Falls. Renowned as a world class recreational steelhead and coho fishery, the greater Bulkley River downstream of Neexdzii Kwah receives some of the heaviest angling pressure in the province. In response to longstanding angler concerns with respect to overcrowding, quality of experience and conflict amongst anglers, an Angling Management Plan was drafted for the river following the initiation of the Skeena Quality Waters Strategy process in 2006 and an extensive multi-year consultation process. The plan introduces a number of regulatory measures with the intent to provide Canadian resident anglers with quality steelhead fishing opportunities. Regulatory measures introduced with the Angling Management Plan include prohibited angling for non-guided non-resident aliens on Saturdays and Sundays, Sept 1 - Oct 31 within the Bulkley River, angling prohibited for non-guided non-resident aliens on Saturdays and Sundays, all year within the Suskwa River and angling prohibited for non-guided non-resident aliens Sept 1 - Oct 31 in the Telkwa River. The Neexdzii Kwah is considered Class II water and there is no fshing permitted upstream of the Morice/Bulkley River Confluence (FLNRO 2013a, 2013b; FLNRORD 2019). 2.4.1.1 Upper Bulkley Falls A detailed field assessment and write up regarding the upper Bulkley falls was conducted as part of fish passage restoration in the watershed - is presented in Irvine (2021) with a condensed summary here. The site was assessed on October 28, 2021 by Nallas Nikal, B.i.T, and Chad Lewis, Environmental Technician. The top of the falls is located at 11U.678269.6038266 at an elevation of 697m approximatley 11.3km downstream of Bulkley Lake and upstream of Ailport Creek. Within the Bulkley River immediately below the 12 - 15m high bedrock falls, channel width was 17.4m and the wetted width was 15.6m. Two channels comprised the falls. The primary channel was 20m long, had a channel/wetted width of 8.5m, a 16% grade and water depths ranging from 35 - 63cm. The secondary channel was 25m long, with channel/wetted widths of 7.5m, a grade of 12% and water depths ranging from 3 - 13cm (Irvine 2021). Dyson (1949) and Stokes (1956) report substantial use of habitat above Bulkley Falls by steelhead, chinook, coho and sockeye utilization in the past (pre-1950) based on spawning reports. Both authors concluded that the Bulkley Falls pose a partial obstruction to migrating fish based on flow levels. Chinook, which migrate early in the summer when water levels are high, have been noted as able to ascend the falls in normal to high water years and in high water years it was thought that coho and steelhead could ascend. A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett (2007) report that the falls are almost completely impassable to all salmon during low water flows. Stokes (1956) reports that there was high value spawning habitat located within the first 3km of the Neexdzii Kwah from the outlet of Bulkley Lake. Wilson and Rabnett (2007) reported thataApproximately 11.3 km downstream of the Bulkley Lake outlet and just upstream of Watson Creek, the upper Bulkley falls is an approximately 4m high narrow rock sill that crosses the Neexdzii Kwah, producing a steep cascade section. This obstacle to fish passage is recorded as an almost complete barrier to fish passage for salmon during low water flows.

Summaries of fish species life history, biology, stock status, and traditional use are documented in Schell (2003), Wilson and Rabnett (2007), Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall (2002) and Office of the Wet’suwet’en (2013). Wilson and Rabnett (2007) discuss chinook, pink, sockeye, coho, steelhead and indigenous freshwater Bulkley River fish stocks within the context of key lower and upper Bulkley River habitats such as the Suskwa River, Station Creek, Harold Price Creek, Telkwa River and Buck Creek. Key areas within the upper Bulkley River watershed with high fishery values, documented in Schell (2003), are the upper Bulkley mainstem, Buck Creek, Dungate Creek, Barren Creek, McQuarrie Creek, Byman Creek, Richfield Creek, Johnny David Creek, Aitken Creek and Emerson Creek. Some areas of high fisheries values for chinook, sockeye and coho are noted in Bustard and Schell (2002) as McBride Lake, Nanika Lake, and Morice Lake watersheds. # In the 1990&#39;s the Morice River watershed, @gottesfeld_rabnett2007SkeenaFish estimated that chinook comprised 30% of the total Skeena system chinook escapements. It is estimated that Morice River coho comprise approximatley 4% of the Skeena escapement with a declining trend noted since the 1950 in @gottesfeld_rabnett2007SkeenaFish Coho spawn in major tributaries and small streams ideally at locations where downstream dispersal can result in seeding of prime off channel habitats including warm productive sloughs and side channels. Of all the salmon species, coho rely on small tributaries the most [@bustard_schell2002ConservingMorice]. @bustard_schell2002ConservingMorice report that much of the distribution of coho into non-natal tributaries occurs during high flow periods of May - early July with road culverts blocking migration into these habitats. fiss_species_table &lt;- readr::read_csv(&#39;data/inputs_extracted/fiss_species_table.csv&#39;) fiss_species_table |&gt; dplyr::select(-Morice) |&gt; fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Fish species recorded in the Bulkley River watershed groups.&#39;, footnote_text = &#39;COSEWIC abbreviations : SC - Special concern DD - Data deficient NAR - Not at risk E - Endangered T - Threatened BC List definitions : Yellow - Species that is apparently secure Blue - Species that is of special concern Exotic - Species that have been moved beyond their natural range as a result of human activity &#39;, scroll = gitbook_on) Table 2.3: Fish species recorded in the Bulkley River watershed groups.

Together, these processes shape rivers and flood planes, which is known as a riverscape (Shahverdian et al. 2019). The goal of process-based restoration is to restore these processes to their the natural rates and magnitudes (essentially stage 0), which leads to the system restoring itself through biological processes and requires minimal corrective intervention Polvi and Wohl (2013). This approach is in contrast to traditional river restoration, which focuses on restoring uniform and static form to the river, such as the channel shape, and is often done through hard engineering and has high costs (Beechie et al. 2010). Principles of process-based restoration adapted from Beechie et al. (2010) are included in Table 2.4. restoration_principles_pb %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = restoration_principles_pb_caption, scroll = FALSE) Table 2.4: Principles of process-based restoration adapted from Beechie et al. (2010). Developed with the aid of GPT-4 as tracked in this link https://chat.openai.com/share/fb0de9b0-0d79-40f8-aec4-a35ac14c1164. Principle Description Target root causes of habitat and ecosystem change Aim at the main factors causing ecosystem decline. Identify and try to reverse the impact of human activities on natural processes. Tailor restoration actions to local potential Each section of a river or stream has its own set of natural features due to its geographic location and climate. Design restoration efforts to align with these inherent characteristics. Match the scale of restoration to the scale of the problem The restoration effort should correspond to the extent of the issue. Localized problems, such as removal of vegetation by a riverbank, need targeted solutions. However, broader impacts like floodplain alteration due to railways, highways, and intensive farming, require numerous actions across the area. Restoring habitats for species that traverse large areas needs planning that covers their entire living range. Be explicit about expected outcomes Restoring natural areas is a slow process, and it may take time to see the results. Natural ecosystems are always changing, and a single project might not lead to immediate, noticeable improvements. Setting clear, measurable goals is crucial for understanding the impact of restoration efforts. Below is an example of process-based restoration using stage 0 methodology done at Deer Creek in Oregon, USA. In this project they filled in incised channels and added large wood to to the river to restore the natural floodplain elevation and re-establish multiple channels (Figure 2.3)(Meyer 2018). Although this project used relatively aggressive restoration techniques, they observed immediate improvements and the benefits were self-sustaining (Figure 2.4)(Meyer 2018). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/stage0_before_after.png&quot;) Figure 2.3: An example of process-based restoration using stage 0 methodology to restored the natural floodplain elevation. In this project they filled in incised channels and added large wood to restore the natural floodplain elevation and re-establish multiple channels (Meyer, 2018). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/deer_creek_before_after.png&quot;) Figure 2.4: Before and after restoration took place at Deer Creek, USA. They observed imediate improvements to the habitat and the benefits were self-sustaining (Meyer, 2018). Process-based restoration also includes many low-cost and low-tech restoration techniques. Resources are sourced from near-by areas, and the restoration is often done by hand, which makes it more accessible to a broad audience and can be done on a smaller scale (Shahverdian et al. 2019). The primary goal of low-tech restoration is to improve the health of as many riverscapes possible by “letting the system do the work” (Shahverdian et al. 2019). Low-cost process-based restoration could be an applicable in the Upper Bulkely riverscape. Some examples of low-cost restoration techniques include: Grazing management Riparian planting Post-assisted log structures (PALS) Beaver damn analogs (BDAs) Further examples of low-cost process-based restoration are available here. 2.5.2 Stage 0 The Stream Evolution Model (SEM) is used to understanding how the morphology of channels (such as rivers or streams) respond to disturbances like changes in base level, channelization, or alterations in flow and sediment regimes (Figure 2.5)(Cluer and Thorne 2014). An important features of the SEM is the inclusion of stage 0, which represents the state of the river before disturbances and is categorized as either an anastomosing wet woodland or an anastomosing grassed wetland (Figure 2.5)(Cluer and Thorne 2014). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/SEM_stages.png&quot;) Figure 2.5: Cluer and Thorne’s (2014) stream evolution model which introduced stage 0, a stage that represents the state of the river before disturbances. The SEM also assigns a hydrogeomorphic attributes and habitat and ecosystem benefits score to each stage (Figure 2.6). Stage 0 is the ultimate restoration goal, but the SEM suggests that there is a big difference in performance between disconnected and incised streams (stages 3-6) and connected streams (stages 7-1), and that stages 7-1 are the best targets for restoration because they have the highest ecosystem potential (Figure 2.6)(Cluer and Thorne 2014). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/SEM_hab_ben.png&quot;) Figure 2.6: Habitat and ecosystem benifits as well as hydrogeomorphic attributes associated with each stage of the SEM, suggesting that stages 7-1 have the highest ecosystem potential (Cluer and Thorne, 2014). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/benefits.png&quot;) Figure 2.7: Examples of how a stage 0 stream can benifit the entire riverscape and play an important role in the biophysical interactions between organisms (Hauer et al., 2016). "],["methods.html", "3 Methods 3.1 Collaborative GIS Environment 3.2 Aerial Imagery 3.3 Open Source - Iterative Reporting 3.4 Historic Information Regarding Impacts and Restoration Initiatives 3.5 Future Restoration Site Selection", " 3 Methods 3.1 Collaborative GIS Environment Geographical Information Systems are essential for developing and communicating restoration plans as well as the reasons they are required and how they are developed. Without the ability to visualize the landscape and the data that is used to make decisions it is difficult to conduct and communicate the need for restoration, the details of past and future plans as well as and the potential results of physical works. To facilitate the planning and implementation of restoration activities in the Neexdzii Kwah (and elsewhere within the Widzin Kwah Water Sustainability Project area), a collaborative GIS environment (titled restoration_wedzin_kwa) has been established using QGIS and Mergin Maps (source code here. This environment is intended to be a space where project team members can access and view and contribute to the amalgamation of background spatial data and the development of restoration as well as monitoring for the project. The collaborative GIS environment allows users to view, edit, and analyze shared up to date spatial data on personal computers in an office setting as well as phones and tablets in the field. At the time of reporting, the environment was being used to develop and share maps, conduct spatial analyses, communicate restoration plans to stakeholders as well as to provide a central place to store methodologies and tools for conducting field assessments on standardized pre-developed digital forms. The platform can also be used to track the progress of restoration activities and monitor changes in the landscape over time helping encourage the record keeping of past and future restoration activities in a coordinated manner. The shared QGIS project was created using scripts currently kept in dff-2022 with the precise calls to project creation scripts tracked in the project_creation_and_permissions.txt document kept in the main QGIS project directory. Information about how GIS project creation and update scripts function can be viewed here with outcomes of their use summarized below: download and clip user specified layers from the BC Data Catalougue as well as data layers stored in custom Amazon Web Services buckets for an area of interest defined by a list of watershed groups and load to a geopackage called background_layers.gpkg stored in the main directory of the project. An additional lateral_habitat.tiff layer is also clipped to the user defined area and loaded to the project. A project directory is created to hold the spatial data and QGIS project information (ie. layer symbology and naming conventions, metadata, etc.). Metadata for individual project spatial layers is kept in the rfp_tracking table within the background_layers.gpkg along with tables related to user supplied stream width/gradient inputs to bcfishpass to model potentially high value habitat that is accessible to fish species of interest. ## QRis # [QGIS Riverscapes Studio](https://qris.riverscapes.net/) (QRis) is a free plugin for QGIS that helps you digitize your riverscape data. QRis is a great planning tool for helping users with spatial representation of riverscapes. # # QRis has two distinct types of features: # # * Static: These are features that are relatively permanent, such as the valley bottom. # * Dynamic: These are features that change over time, such as the active channel. # # QRis will be a useful tool for digitizing the upper Wetzin&#39;kwa river and prioritizing restoration sites. To start using QRis, follow the instructions for [getting started](https://qris.riverscapes.net/getting-started/). 3.2 Aerial Imagery Scripted processing and serving of UAV imagery collected during the project is available at https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/stac_uav_bc/ (Irvine [2025] 2025). OpenDroneMap was utilized to produce orthomosaics, digital surface models (DSMs), and digital terrain models (DTMs) (OpenDroneMap Authors [2014] 2025). To support efficient web-based access - imagery products were converted to cloud-optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) using rio-cogeo, then collated accordiong to the SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) specification with pystac and uploaded to S3 storage Amazon Web Services (2025). A titiler tile server was set up to facilitate interactive viewing of the orthoimagery and an Application Program Interface (API) leveraging stac-fastapi-pgstac is served at https://images.a11s.one to enable linking of collection images through QGIS as well as remote spatial and temporal querying using open source software such as rstac (Development Seed [2019] 2025; stac-utils 2025; Simoes et al. 2021). 3.3 Open Source - Iterative Reporting A key question we have been asking ourselves is: “What is the most useful way to present information?” From our perspective - the most useful way to present information is in a version controlled format that allows it to be interactive, reproducible, read online, served out as a static document, updated, copied, used as a template, etc. Iterative reporting, managed with a version control system such as git (see example of tracking edits here) with a permissive license is a great way to do all those things. Although there is a steep learning curve to using programming tools and producing this type of product and although it can be quite time consuming - it then allows leveraging of all the components of the work to future projects for everyone. Licensing is also key for work to be shared. MIT License is an example of a license that promotes collaboration and sharing/leveraging of work while. From our perspective - restoration planning are the type of initiatives that are well suited to an iterative reporting format such as can be demonstrated within this code repository which builds and serves this online report. 3.3.1 Issue and Discussion Tracking Issues and discussions are effective ways to track tasks, enhancements, and bugs for the project. Issues can be used to keep track of all the things that need to be done, and can be used to discuss in-line with references to code used to address them linked to the issues through git commit messages. Issues for this project are kept here and discussions are kept here. 3.3.2 Tables and Figures There are many tables within this document that can take a long time to format. Within this document the tables have been imported often as simple csv files or pages of an excel workbook and pulled into the project using scripts. This allows others to access the data and use it in their own projects. These tables can also then be easily updated with new data as it becomes available often with the formatting for presentation to reader handled by the scripting. Any figures used in the reporting are saved in the project here and can be leveraged by others. # An example of this can be # seen here in Table \\@ref(tab:kable-resources) with the actual file served # [here](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/restoration_wedzin_kwa_2024/tree/main/data): read_csv(&quot;data/aquatic_restoration_resources.csv&quot;) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &quot;Aquatic Restoration Resources.&quot;) 3.3.3 Data Sourceing from Skeena Salmon Data Centre Whenever possible we have attempted to tie into existing data govenment infrastructure in the Skeena region by downloading data directly from the Skeena Salmon Data Centre using the application programming interface to their CKAN database. To facilitate and simlify this process we developed a function to download data from the CKAN database and load it into local versions of the project repository. This fetch_package function is kept in the scripts/functions.R file of the project and can be used to download entire “packages” of data from the Skeena Salmon Data Centre. 3.3.4 Documentation of Workflows Select workflows were documented in memo format to illustrate the process used for others and promote reproducibility/leverageing of Neexdzii Kwah. The memos are stored in the memo directory of the project here and can be viewed in Table Table 3.1 by downloading the .html documents to a local computer and opening in a web browser such as Chrome (usually a double click of the document will open it in the browser). ## make a tibble of the list and display it as a fpr_kable list.files(&quot;memos&quot;, full.names = FALSE) %&gt;% tibble::tibble(memo_name = .) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &quot;Memos stored at https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/restoration_wedzin_kwa_2024/tree/main/memos.&quot;, scroll = FALSE, scroll_box_height = &quot;300px&quot; ) Table 3.1: Memos stored at https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/restoration_wedzin_kwa_2024/tree/main/memos. memo_name dfo_stock_assess.html historic_site_tidy.html track_sites_restoration.html 3.4 Historic Information Regarding Impacts and Restoration Initiatives Historic information regarding impacts and restoration initiatives, prescriptions and activities is an important component of the restoration planning process. A wealth of information is present for the Neexdzii Kwah however it is located in many different locations and not always spatially represented. To address this, a comprehensive review of past impact indentification and restoration recommendations is underway. This review included a review of the literature, interviews with local experts, and a review of the restoration prescriptions and activities that have been conducted in the Neexdzii Kwah. For information regarding relatively recent restoration efforts such as physical works conducted through Healthy Watersheds Initiative, representatives from the Morice Watershed Monitoring Trust amalgamated all information located on physical drives and either provided emails with the data attached or provided links to the data for the study team for download and review. This information was then subsequently downloaded and re-uploaded to a OneDrive folder for the study team to access. 3.5 Future Restoration Site Selection 3.5.1 Evaluation of Historic and Current Imagery Evaluation of historic and current imagery to understand and quantify watershed characteristics and morphological changes in the Neexdzii Kwah and its major tributaries over time and guide future restoration efforts. This will require that the study team acquire, georeference, archive and analyze historic imagery for the Neexdzii Kwah watershed and compare with an analysis of recent data to quantify historic changes in stream morphology resulting in loss of quantity and quality of water and fish habitat. Through this process we hope to highlight areas of historic dredging, realignment, and floodplain disconnections due to infrastructure that have degraded watershed health and fish habitat. 3.5.2 Fish Passage At the time of writing, extensive work related to fish passage restoration planning was underway in the Neexdzii Kwah watershed as well as other areas of the greater Skeena watershed. Methodology for this work is presented in Irvine and Schick (2025), Irvine and Schick (2024), Irvine and Wintersheidt (2023), Irvine, Wintersheidt, and Schick (2023), Irvine (2021) and Irvine (2018). Although these references detail work primarily related to linear connectivity (ie. upstream/downstream) there is also ongoing work related to lateral connectivity (ie. floodplain connectivity) with methodology related to disconnections due to the linear infrastructure documented in bcfishpass (Norris [2020] 2024) here. The results of this analysis and future analysis incorporating major roadways as well (currently under development) will be added to the shared QGIS project and used to inform future restoration activity prioritization. 3.5.3 Local Knowledge for Riparian Area and Erosion Protection Site Selection To facilitate project activities in the short term - the project team conducted site visits to areas of known riparian removal and bank erosion where landowners are amenable to project activities including erosion protection, installation of cattle exclusion fencing and riparian planting. 3.5.4 Delineation of Areas of High Fisheries Values Past work to spatially delineate areas of high value habitat known to be utilized historically for chinook and sockeye salmon spawning (among other data) undertaken by DFO, Arocha Canada and others has been stored within a secure location and linked within the shared GIS project. Wilson and Rabnett (2007) includes descriptions of traditional Wet’suwet’en Fisheries sites within the Neexdzi Kwa which will be spatialized for the project. 3.5.5 Parameter Ranking to Select Future Restoration Sites Analysis of background and current data can be used to inform priority ranking criteria used to select sites for restoration activities in the long term. Although the process is ongoing - GIS and user input parameters were selected based on ongoing project team meetings and review of available spatial information to rank future restoration sites. Using custom functions and scripted workflows based on layers kept within the shared GIS project - we prioritized proposed sites dynamically based on a range of metrics and user defined ranking. Scripts to conduct the analysis can be found here with custom functions here. "],["results.html", "4 Results 4.1 Field Review 4.2 Collaborative GIS Environment 4.3 Aerial Imagery 4.4 Historic Information Regarding Impacts and Restoration Initiatives 4.5 Future Restoration Site Selection", " 4 Results 4.1 Field Review In the field in September and early October 2024 we were able to survey approximately 12 km of Bulkley and Buck mainstem along with 1.5 km of Johnny David and Richfield. Within those areas and elsewhere we reviewed: 14 past prescription sites from NCFDC (1998) 6 prescription locations from the Wet’suwet’en First Nation 2016 report (2 sites were mapped in high resolution with a drone), 6 past Healthy Watersheds Initiative sites 7 newly proposed sites including both Groot fencing locations, 3 sites on the Wilson property and 2 previously undocumented sites on Mients’ property (3 sites were mapped in high resolution with a drone) 3 erosion protection sites in the Fraser (on the Lower Chilako River) completed by Chelton VanGloven (2 sites were mapped in high resolution with a drone) At the time of writing - most of the raw information from this fieldwork was viewable within layers stored the shared QGIS project in the Project Specific/Field Data/2024 group. Many of the photos from site visits documented in those layers are within the GIS project as well (in desktop QGIS project they are in the ignore_mobile/photos directory). A brief summary of result is below: A recurring theme we observed where prescriptions were drafted and/or where work has been completed or proposed was obvious impacts related to riparian/floodplain vegetation removal and damage to sensitive areas due to cattle trampling and cattle waste products. At past sites where investments have been made - there were insignificant widths set aside for riparian/floodplain vegetation restoration/recovery. The protection of road and rail infrastructure through streambank armoring is not adequately incorporating best practices for vegetating riprap, soft armouring where possible and establishing/restoring effective riparian buffers. 4.2 Collaborative GIS Environment A summary of background information layers loaded to the background_layers.gpkg geopackage of the restoration_wedzin_kwa project at the time of writing are included in Table 4.1. # first we will copy the doc from the Q project to this repo - the location of the Q project is outside of the repo!! q_path_stub &lt;- &quot;~/Projects/gis/restoration_wedzin_kwa/&quot; rfp_tracking_raw &lt;- sf::st_read(paste0(q_path_stub, &quot;background_layers.gpkg&quot;), layer = &quot;rfp_tracking&quot;, quite = TRUE) # grab the metadata md &lt;- rfp::rfp_meta_bcd_xref() # remove the `_vw` from the end of content rfp_tracking_prep &lt;- dplyr::left_join( rfp_tracking_raw %&gt;% dplyr::arrange(desc(timestamp)) %&gt;% dplyr::distinct(content, .keep_all = FALSE), md |&gt; dplyr::select(content = object_name, url = url_browser, description), by = &quot;content&quot; ) |&gt; dplyr::mutate(url = dplyr::case_when( stringr::str_detect(content, &quot;bcfishobs|bcfishpass&quot;) ~ &quot;https://smnorris.github.io/bcfishpass/06_data_dictionary.html&quot;, TRUE ~ url)) |&gt; arrange(content) rfp_tracking_prep %&gt;% readr::write_csv(&quot;data/rfp_tracking_prep.csv&quot;) rfp_tracking_prep &lt;- readr::read_csv( &quot;data/rfp_tracking_prep.csv&quot; ) rfp_tracking_prep %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &quot;Layers loaded to collaborative GIS project.&quot;, footnote_text = &quot;Metadata information for bcfishpass and bcfishobs layers can be provided here in the future but currently can usually be sourced from https://smnorris.github.io/bcfishpass/06_data_dictionary.html .&quot;) Table 4.1: Layers loaded to collaborative GIS project. content url description bcfishobs.fiss_fish_obsrvtn_events_vw https://smnorris.github.io/bcfishpass/06_data_dictionary.html – bcfishpass.crossings_vw https://smnorris.github.io/bcfishpass/06_data_dictionary.html – bcfishpass.streams_vw https://smnorris.github.io/bcfishpass/06_data_dictionary.html – reg_legal_and_admin_boundaries.qsoi_bc_regions https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/69ea1b64-e7ce-481c-b0b5-e6450111697d Statement of Intent Boundaries Registered with the BC Treaty Commission at date of production whse_admin_boundaries.clab_indian_reserves https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/8efe9193-80d2-4fdf-a18c-d531a94196ad Provide the administrative boundaries (extent) of Canada Lands which includes Indian Reserves.

Records from the following datasets have been included: The Fisheries Information Summary System (FISS); the Fish Habitat Inventory and Information Program (FHIIP); the Field Data Information System (FDIS) and the Resource Analysis Branch (RAB) inventory studies. The main intent of this layer is to have a single layer of all known obstacles to fish passage. It is important to note that not all waterbodies have been studied and, not all lengths of many waterbodies have been studied so there are a very high number of obstacles in the real world that are not recorded in this dataset. This layer simply reports the obstacles to fish that are known. It is also very important to note that we are acknowledging these features as obstacles to fish passage versus barriers to fish passage. This is because an obstacle may be a barrier at one time of year but not at other times depending on the volume of water present and also, what is a barrier to one species of fish is not necessarily a barrier to another species. whse_fish.fiss_stream_sample_sites_sp https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/e616864b-8991-42d1-a2f9-4d4402c32be8 This spatial layer displays stream inventory sample sites that have had full or partial surveys, and contains measurements or indicator information of the data collected at each survey site on each date. whse_fish.pscis_assessment_svw https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/7ecfafa6-5e18-48cd-8d9b-eae5b5ea2881 Points where a fish passage assessment has been performed on a stream crossing structure.

Design points have been identified as a priority for remediation based on a variety of potential criteria: quality of habitat upstream, quantity of fish habitat upstream, number and importance of species present, operational plans for the road cost of the proposed remediation, etc. They are sites where the amount of habitat to be gained by remediation has been confirmed and where a design has actually been completed. whse_fish.pscis_habitat_confirmation_svw https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/572595ab-0a25-452a-a857-1b6bb9c30495 Points where an evaluation of the fish habitat up and downstream of a road crossing have been carried out. Phase 2 of 4 in the Fish Passage Workflow, Habitat Confirmations are done at sites where the crossing structure is known to be a failure. The Habitat Confirmation is performed to ensure that the site in question is a good candidate for moving on to the Design (Phase 3) and Remediation (Phase 4) stages of the workflow.

Burn severity mapping is conducted using best available pre- and post-fire satellite multispectral imagery acquired by the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) aboard the Sentinel-2 satellite or the Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor aboard the Landsat-8 and 9 satellites. The post-fire imagery is acquired during the subsequent growing season. Mapping conducted during the subsequent growing season benefits from greater post-fire image availability and is expected to be more representative of tree mortality. Every attempt is made to use cloud, smoke, shadow and snow-free imagery that was acquired prior to September 30th. Please note, this layer is 1-year-later burn severity dataset. The same-year burn severity mapping dataset (WHSE_FOREST_VEGETATION.VEG_BURN_SEVERITY_SAME_YR_SP) is considered an interim product to this layer. 4.2.0.1 Methodology: • Select suitable pre- and post-fire imagery or create a cloud/snow/smoke-free composite from multiple images scenes • Calculate normalized burn severity ratio (NBR) for pre- and post-fire images • Calculate difference NBR (dNBR) where dNBR = pre NBR – post NBR • Apply a scaling equation (dNBR_scaled = dNBR*1000 + 275)/5) • Apply BARC thresholds (76, 110, 187) to create a 4-class image (unburned, low severity, medium severity, and high severity) • Apply region-based filters to reduce noise • Confirm burn severity analysis results through visual quality control • Produce a vector dataset and apply Euclidian distance smoothing whse_forest_vegetation.veg_comp_lyr_r1_poly https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/2ebb35d8-c82f-4a17-9c96-612ac3532d55 Geospatial forest inventory dataset updated for depletions, such as harvesting, and projected annually for growth.

In the event of a discrepancy in the data, the metes and bounds description will prevail. Although the boundaries were drawn based on the legal metes and bounds descriptions, they may differ from how regional districts and their member municipalities and electoral areas currently view and/or manage their boundaries. Where discrepancies are noted, the Ministry of Municipal Affairs (the custodian) enters into discussion with the local governments whose boundaries are affected. In order to effect a change to the boundary, Cabinet approval is required. This is done through an Order in Council (OIC). While discrepancies to administrative boundaries are being resolved, boundaries may be adjusted on an ongoing basis until the requested changes are completed. The OIC_YEAR and OIC_NUMBER fields indicate the year that the boundary was passed under OIC and its associated number.

An incidental observation is a recorded detection of a species or its sign that was not a part of a formalized survey. This can occur when a non-focal species is observed during a survey for another species, outside of the study area, or as a chance observation made at random. The validity of these sightings is widely variable depending on the level of expertise of the observer and how visible the animal(s) was.

Boulder Creek flows into the main stem of the Bulkley River approximately 11 km north of Moricetown and about 120 km north of the confluence of the Neexdzii Kwa and Wetzin Kwa Rivers. The 68 streams were assessed using topographic maps and air photo interpretation to evaluate the degree and nature of impacts from transportation and hydroelectric corridors, powerlines, agriculture, grazing, and municipal land use. The most significant sources of impact were identified as agricultural/rangeland and municipal development (Mitchell 1997). Streams were prioritized into six categories (1 through 6) based on the number and severity of impacts, the length of potential fish habitat, and the presence of significant (e.g., salmonid or regionally important) fish populations. Neexdzi Kwa tributaries ranked in the highest two priority categories (highly or severely degraded) included Buck Creek, Maxxan Creek, Watson Creek, Airport Creek, Cesford Creek, Richfield Creek, Byman Creek, and McQuarrie Creek. Those falling into categories 3 and 4 (moderately degraded) included Foxy Creek, Jonny David Creek, Barren Creek, Crow Creek, and the Sunset-Elwin system, among others. Tributaries within the lowest two priority categories included Aitken Creek and McKilligan Creek (Mitchell 1997). 4.4.2 Price (2014) - Upper Bulkley floodplain habitat: modifications, physical barriers, and sites of potential importance to salmonids Price (2014) documented human-induced modifications to floodplain habitat and river channelization, investigated potential barriers to fish migration, and assessed areas of upwelling groundwater in the Upper Bulkley mainstem having potential importance to salmonids. The coordinates of points of interest were extracted from a pdf version of the report and are included in the price_2014_waypoints.csv file located here and were added to the sites_restoration.gpkg (layer name = price_2014).

Place several large to extralarge sizeclass LWD with rootwads facing the current in a crosswise pattern armouring the top of the bar. Bury the top half of these trees in the streambed. This configuration will promote sedimentation downstream, and an excellent environment for the seed and whips of shrubs and trees to colonize the tail end of the bar. LWD is to be transported from a road site and moved into place with the aid of a horse logging company and a crew to assist in finetuning the placements of logs.

Extensive floodplain development for hay cultivation, anddiversion of the river has led to poor floodplain and riparian function and extensivesurface erosion during overbank floods. To restore floodplain functions, rehabilitate riparian forest and reduce surfaceerosion of unforested and compacted soils by restoring and revegetating overbank floodchannels. I. Restoring floodplain function and lateral channel movement where feasible to increase spatial habitat diversity and improve overwintering and summer rearing habitat, buffer high and low water levels and water temperatures downstream, and increase overbank sediment storage.II. Mitigate flood damage by overbank flooding and improve offchannel habitat creation and access to the mainstem on cleared land by revegetating and reconnecting floodplain flood channels and baffling them with LWD in key locations. Assess and map feasible flood channels in this area for restoration, provided landowner cooperation can be secured. Using large cottonwood stems, baffle the floodplain channels with LWD. Stems should be oriented in twos in a vformation with the apex of two stems pointing upstream. This will promote deepening of these channels and concentration of the flow in the next overbank flood, rather than the opposite effect. Extensively plant the channels with shrub species and the margins of the channels with climax vegetation. There should be a 3050 metre buffer strip of vegetation around each flood channel. Fence the areas off to livestock if they are present.Note This is a relatively untested method and capital intensive prescription which mayyield significant positive results. The potential for a combination of restoring floodplainfunction and rare floodplain riparian forest and creating abundant offchannel habitat inthis geomorphically important and active area is promising. However, there is also asignificant risk of failure and damage to private land and the fisheries resource strandingand sedimentation of downstream habitat if the appropriate specialists geomorphologist, river engineer are not consulted.

Survey and design phase including consultation with a river engineer andor geomorphologist. Construction of two attracting groynes and one set of opposing wing deflectors using hard materials instream. Structures are constructed at 27 metre intervals from each other. Attracting groynes are oriented 45o downstream from the bank. Rock material is placed in a trench dug to 1 metre below the bed surface to reduce the chance of undercutting. Lateral grade from the bank to the apex of the groyne is 150. The height of the groyne is the average wetted depth in the channelized section. Size of materials should be 25.5 cm baxis diameter or larger average D in riffles in this reach times a safety factor of 1.5. The opposing wing deflectors are constructed at 45o up and downstream from the bank on either axis. Rock material is placed in trenches dug to 1 metre below the existing bed surface. Lateral grade from the bank to the apex of the deflector should ensure that the bank end root is to bankfull height and the apex is 0.3 metres above the mean water level. Rock material on the upstream face should be larger than downstream recommended size in WRTC9 is 2 m diameter on upstream face. The interior of the deflector can be filled with smaller granular spoil. Low growing and overhanging shrubs are planted in the riprap as per the riparian prescription. Signs are to be placed indicating the riparian works to railway and road maintenance crews.

These approaches focus on supporting habitat for steelhead, chinook, coho, trout, and char. Funding for the project was provided by Fisheries and Oceans Canada’s Fish Habitat Restoration Initiative and through in-kind support from landowners and West Fraser. Yinka Dene Economic Development Limited Partnership Inc. (YLP), in collaboration with LGL Limited, developed designs and management plans for 16 high-priority sites in Wet’suwet’en First Nation territory between 2015 and 2019. Related construction efforts are documented in Smith and Gaboury (2016) and Smith and Gaboury (2017), including work at at four of these sites in 2016 as well as Johnny David Creek at Highway 16 in 2017. Site locations and associated data from this report have been added to the shared GIS project. 4.4.5 Skeena Sustainability Assessment Forum (2021) - State of the Value Report for Fish and Fish Habitat The Skeena Sustainability Assessment Forum (SSAF) is a collaborative environmental stewardship initiative established under the Environmental Stewardship Initiative (ESI), bringing together 10 Skeena Nations and the Province of British Columbia. The SSAF supports shared decision-making by integrating Indigenous knowledge, scientific data, and local values to assess the state and trends of key environmental resources, including fish and fish habitat (Environmental Stewardship Initiative 2019). As part of this work, the SSAF State of the Value Report for Fish and Fish Habitat summarized conditions across the study area using data available up to 2018. The analysis was completed at the assessment watershed level and considered a range of environmental indicators related to land and water use, natural watershed features, and salmon presence. This first phase of work is designed to be built upon with improved monitoring and data over time. The amalgamated results have been integrated into the shared GIS project, and a summary table of indicators and spatial output field descriptions is included in Appendix – State of the Value – Fish and Fish Habitat (#app-esi) (Government of British Columbia 2023; Skeena Sustainability Assessment Forum 2021). 4.5 Future Restoration Site Selection 4.5.1 Evaluation of Historic and Current Imagery As part of this project - we developed a system to identify the IDs of historic ortho photos for specific timeframes and areas within the Upper Bulkley watershed. The system is designed to be flexible, allowing adjustments to parameters such as input year and location, and it can be adapted for use in other regions across the province. Next steps include aquisition of photos from the province which will enable georeferencing, amalgamation, storage and analysis. Details on the system and the code developed are outlined here, with individual photo IDs for the study area available here. Of note, direct communications with the provincial Image Warehouse Specialist resulted in details of images available for the study area for 1949 and 1963 (prior to those detailed at the above site) - which at the time of reporting had not yet been updated to Web Imagery Search Interface or the provincial Base Map Online Store [Government of British Columbia (2024); Government of British Columbia (2025); pers comm Koraley Tylor - Image Warehouse Specialist]. We have included this information within the project code repository here. 4.5.2 Fish Passage High priority fish passage restoration opportunities in the Neexdzii Kwah watershed include mulitple culverts on Highway 16 such as Richfield Creek, Johnny David Creek, and Byman Creek along with crossings on private roads, secondary roads and the railway such as Ailport Creek, Perow Creek, tributary to Buck Creek (PSCIS 197640) and Cesford Creek. Some sites have had past work (Johnny David) and others are currently progressing through the design process (trib to Buck) with details presented in the reports below - which are updated intermittently. Of note Irvine and Schick (2025) includes summary tables within the “Results and Discussion” section which detail all sites surveyed since 2020 and link the reader to individual reports and detailed site memos for each site (when available). Additionally, the top priorities within the greater Bulkley River watershed group are ranked numerically within the table includeing Richfield Creek, Ailport Creek, Cesford Creek and Johnny David Creek within the top ten.

The results of this analysis are included in the lateral_habitat.tif layer in the and viewable in the restoration_wedzin_kwa project. The results of this analysis and future analysis incorporating major roadways as well (currently under development) will be used to inform future restoration activities. 4.5.3 Local Knowledge for Riparian Area and Erosion Protection Site Selection Numerous sites proposed for riparian area and erosion protection activities are are viewable in the restoration_wedzin_kwa project. These sites were selected based on local knowledge and landowner willingness to participate in restoration activities. 4.5.4 Delineation of Areas of High Fisheries Values As noted within the methods - past work to spatially delineate areas of high value habitat known to be utilized historically for chinook and sockeye salmon spawning (among other data) undertaken by DFO, Arocha Canada and others has been stored within a secure location and linked within the shared GIS project. Wilson and Rabnett (2007) includes descriptions of traditional Wet’suwet’en Fisheries sites within the Neexdzi Kwa which will be spatialized for the project - with progress tracked here. 4.5.5 Parameter Ranking to Select Future Restoration Sites A summary of an initial draft of GIS and user input parameters used to rank future restoration sites generated from the restoration_site_priority_parameters.csv file located here is included in Table 4.8. Outputs from an intitial proof of concept run are included within the shared GIS project and collated within Appendix 5 – Example of Potential Restoration Sites Prioritized. Please note that any parameters included in the Skeena Sustainability Assessment Forum - State of the Value - Fish and Fish Habitat assessment here can now be included in the ranking - provided the attribute to rank is added to the input spreadsheet and ranking weights applied. # load the data gis_params_raw_all &lt;- readr::read_csv( &quot;data/inputs_raw/restoration_site_priority_parameters_raw.csv&quot; ) gis_params_raw_to_update &lt;- gis_params_raw_all|&gt; # dplyr::filter(!is.na(source_layer) &amp; # !is.na(source_column_name) &amp; # !str_detect(source_layer, &quot;bcfishobs|bcfishpass&quot;)) |&gt; dplyr::filter(!is.na(source_layer) &amp; !is.na(source_column_name) &amp; # remove bcfishpass, esi, local hab layers !stringr::str_detect(source_layer, &quot;bcfishobs|bcfishpass|chinook|skeena_east&quot;)) |&gt; # we know that tenures and the land ownership layers are problematic so lets remove dplyr::filter(!stringr::str_detect(source_layer, &quot;whse_forest_tenure.ften_range_poly_carto_vw|whse_cadastre.pmbc_parcel_fabric_poly_svw&quot;)) # grab the details about the source_layer as source_schema_table_details and then the # source_column_name as source_column_name_details gis_param_details_prep_schtab &lt;- dplyr::left_join( gis_params_raw_to_update, rfp::rfp_meta_bcd_xref(), by = c(&quot;source_layer&quot; = &quot;object_name&quot;) ) # grab the column details params_cols_des &lt;- purrr::map2_df( gis_param_details_prep_schtab$source_layer, gis_param_details_prep_schtab$source_column_name, rfp::rfp_meta_bcd_xref_col_comments ) # left_join the column details to the gis_param_details_prep_schtab gis_param_details_prep &lt;- dplyr::left_join( gis_param_details_prep_schtab, params_cols_des, by = c(&quot;source_layer&quot; = &quot;object_name&quot;, &quot;source_column_name&quot; = &quot;col_name&quot;) ) # need to add back all the layers filtered out above - this should not be repeated but will do for now gis_params_raw_all_updated &lt;- dplyr::bind_rows( gis_params_raw_all |&gt; dplyr::filter(is.na(source_layer) | is.na(source_column_name) | stringr::str_detect(source_layer, &quot;bcfishobs|bcfishpass|chinook|skeena_east&quot;) | # not accessible via bcdata stringr::str_detect(source_layer, &quot;whse_forest_tenure.ften_range_poly_carto_vw|whse_cadastre.pmbc_parcel_fabric_poly_svw&quot;)), gis_param_details_prep ) |&gt; dplyr::mutate(url_browser = dplyr::case_when( stringr::str_detect(source_layer, &quot;bcfishobs|bcfishpass&quot;) ~ &quot;https://smnorris.github.io/bcfishpass/06_data_dictionary.html&quot;, TRUE ~ url_browser) ) |&gt; dplyr::mutate(is_wet_cultural_site = source_column_name == &quot;wet_cultural_site&quot;) |&gt; dplyr::arrange( desc(is_wet_cultural_site), rank # source_layer, # source_column_name, # column_name )|&gt; dplyr::select(-is_wet_cultural_site) # dplyr::arrange(rank, source_layer, source_column_name, column_name) # this is time consuming so lets save it as a csv and make this chunk conditional on the gis_update flag gis_params_raw_all_updated |&gt; readr::write_csv(&quot;data/restoration_site_priority_parameters.csv&quot;) tab_gis_params_raw &lt;- readr::read_csv(&quot;data/restoration_site_priority_parameters.csv&quot;) # dplyr::select( # source_layer, # source_column_name, # column_name, # user_input, # type, # url_browser, # # description_table = description, # col_comments # ) |&gt; # dplyr::arrange(user_input, group, group_sub, column_name) |&gt; # dplyr::select(column_name, source_column_name, everything()) my_caption = &quot;Example of parameter selection and ranking system to prioritize potential restoration/enhancement sites.&quot; my_tab_caption() Table 4.8: Example of parameter selection and ranking system to prioritize potential restoration/enhancement sites.

Recovery efforts must go beyond technical interventions and include a commitment to learning from the vast body of knowledge held by the Wetsuwet’en people. This includes understanding cultural practices, oral tradition (Kungax), Wet’suwet’en Law (Ink Nu’at’en), place names, family connections, house groups (Yihk), poles (Ts’an), the feast system (Bahlats), etc (Harris 2011). There is extensive literature documenting these histories, including records from the Delgamuukw trial , which can begin to provide a foundation for understanding the cultural significance of this landscape (University of British Columbia Library n.d.). Developing comprehensive restoration planning for the Neexdzii Kwah watershed will help ensure that the restoration activities address the underlying drivers of the degradation necessitating restoration. Through partnerships, education, and resource-sharing, stakeholders can work together to align ecological goals with economic interests, ensuring long-term benefits for the watershed. The following recommendations are provided to try to ensure that the restoration activities are most effective by addressing the underlying drivers of the degradation. At the time of writing this can be considered a partial list as the project is still in development and the recommendations are subject to change as the project progresses: # 1. Amalgamate effectiveness monitoring information and present within online reporting to facilitate adaptive management through sharing and review. Evolve program to leverage past monitoring methodology and data include an updated monitoring schedule, monitoring objectives, and methods. Methodology using Watershed Restoration Procedures - Routine effectiveness evaluation procedures and riparian inventory techniques ([LMH25](https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hfd/pubs/Docs/Lmh/Lmh25/Lmh25_ed2_(2010).pdf) - percent cover by structural stage, species composition, etc.) could be utilized using pre-built digital forms served to field teams from the collaborative GIS project. # # 1. Design long term water monitoring program to leverage past work and attempt to quantify upstream water quality impacts via tools such as [CABIN](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/canadian-aquatic-biomonitoring-network/resources.html) sampling program [@canada2008CanadianAquatic], 5 sample in 30 day water quality sampling during both high and low flow periods [@wlrs2024BritishColumbia; @moe2024BritishColumbia], continuation/expansion of [temperature monitoring](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/skeena.knowledge.trust/viz/UBRWaterTemperatureMonitoringDashboardDraft/UBRWaterTemp_Dashboard) [@skeenaknowledgetrustUBRWater, @westcott2022UpperBulkleya], quantify amounts of water withdrawn by licensees in the upper Bulkley catchment during the April to September low flow period, etc). Importantly, careful consideration of how to implement water quality program recommendations from @price2014UpperBulkleya, @oliver2020Analysis2017 and @westcott2022UpperBulkleya during this process is also recommended. # # # 2. Incentivize and help coordinate range tenure practice improvements (off-site watering, rotational field use, riparian exclusion, monitoring, range use plan updates that reduce cattle load, range stewardship planning that includes &quot;red&quot; zones for cattle exclusion, etc.) to reduce cattle impacts on riparian and water quality values. Cattle waste loading to tributary and mainstem habitats is of paramount concern as water quality degradation due to high biological oxygen demand related to nutrient loading will undermine the ability of aquatic life to recover from cumulative impacts in the watershed. # # 3. Leverage and expand existing education programs for youth related to watershed health and cultural/ecosystem significance of fish/riparian/wildlife values to provide outreach for all school aged and post-secondary students in the greater Skeena region. # # 4. Work with organizations such as the Woodmere Nursery, Skeena based &quot;Seed the North&quot;, knowledge holders and others to develop a local seed collection and propagation program to increase capacity for floodplain revegetation that can be scaled up to meet the challenges faced by historic removal of these native vegetation communities. # # 10. In our recent field assessments, we observed that the protection of road and rail infrastructure through streambank armoring is not adequately incorporating best practices for vegetating riprap, soft armouring where possible and establishing/restoring effective riparian buffers. This oversight can significantly impact watershed health and biodiversity. To address this issue, we recommend collaborating with relevant stakeholders to advocate for the documentation, evolution, and dissemination of best practices related to streambank armoring. # # 4. Develop a schedule for on the ground monitoring via pre-planned instream surveys (walks) of mainstem and tributary habitats and riparian recovery/monitoring. Map these &quot;trail&quot; systems and document values within them. Increasing the presence of First Nation representatives, environmental practitioners and regulators within valuable streams within the Neexdzi Kwa watershed - regardless of land ownership - will help educate surveyors on the current state of these systems, provide information regarding recovery effort results and incentivize responsible land management by landowners/managers in the region. # # # 6. Select and refine parameters to prioritize future recovery program type (ex. water quality monitoring, range management program, education initiative, riparian vegetation recovery, expanded seed collection/propogation program, erosion protection, etc.) and allocate available dollars accordingly. After financial and capacity resources are delineated by recovery program type - select parameters, and weight a ranking system for each to inform prioritization of specific sites within each recovery program. For physical actions such as riparian fencing for cattle exclusion, riparian/floodplain vegetation recovery and erosion protection include prioritization criteria that incorporates the amount of riparian/floodplain area available for recovery (ie. the wider the buffer available for meaningful native floodplain vegetation community establishment - the higher the priority for investment). Utilize established standards when possible such as the [Riparian Areas Protection Regulation](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/plants-animals-ecosystems/fish/aquatic-habitat-management/riparian-areas-regulation) and the [Riparian Management Area Guidebook](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/forestry/managing-our-forest-resources/silviculture/silvicultural-systems/silviculture-guidebooks/riparian-management-area-guidebook) [@ministryofforests1995RiparianManagement]. # # 7. Working with watershed users—including industrial players like railways and highways, as well as landowners and range tenure holders—is essential for promoting water retention through beaver activity. The Beaver Restoration Assessment Tool (BRAT) can guide efforts by identifying areas where beaver activity can optimize water retention and flow regulation. Beavers are natural ecosystem engineers; their dams slow water flow, enhance groundwater recharge, and reduce flood risks, while also improving water quality by trapping sediments and filtering pollutants. Providing incentives to landowners and tenure holders to support water retention on the landscape can help catalyze beaver influenced wetlands throughout the watershed addressing potential land use conflicts while aligning ecological goals with economic interests. # # 5. Acquire, georeference, archive (within SKT) and analyze historic aerial imagery for the Neexdzii Kwah watershed and compare with recent orthoimagery and/or LiDAR data to quantify historic changes in stream morphology and floodplain extent resulting in loss of quantity and quality of water and fish habitat while highlighting areas of historic dredging, realignment, and floodplain disconnections due to infrastructure, to guide future restoration efforts. Script all analysis when possible to facilitate reproducibility and sharing of the analysis. # # 8. Continue to develop and document data management workflows to leverage existing established data storage systems to retrieve data from and load to and build capacity for all interested to do the same. Established data storage systems include the [BC Data Catalogue](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/), the [Skeena Salmon Data Centre](https://data.skeenasalmon.info/), [NuSEDS-New Salmon Escapement Database System](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/c48669a3-045b-400d-b730-48aafe8c5ee6) and [bcfishpass](https://github.com/smnorris/bcfishpass/tree/main/data) # # # 9. Amalgamate drone acquired ortho-imagery gathered for sites in the Neexdzii Kwah watershed, store as Cloud Optimized Geotiffs on a cloud service provider and link to the imagery via the collaborative GIS project. Orthoimagery has been gathered for past monitoring of historic restoration sites as well as part of fish passage restoration planning efforts. # # # # # # 12. Link historic and potential future sites to the freshwater atlas using the linear feature id of stream segments and conduct watershed drainage area analysis for individual stream segments (or portions of steram segments) so that this area can be tied to other GIS and user input parameters. Functions kept in [fwapg](https://github.com/smnorris/fwapg), [fwapgr](https://github.com/poissonconsulting/fwapgr), [fwatlasbc](https://github.com/poissonconsulting/fwatlasbc) and custom function developed for this project can be used. Results from this can be compared to other methods for determining project setbacks from the high water mark such as the [Riparian Areas Protection Regulation](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/plants-animals-ecosystems/fish/aquatic-habitat-management/riparian-areas-regulation) and the [Riparian Management Area Guidebook](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/forestry/managing-our-forest-resources/silviculture/silvicultural-systems/silviculture-guidebooks/riparian-management-area-guidebook) [@ministryofforests1995RiparianManagement]. # # # 14. Spatially represent historic fisheries sites presented in Table \\@ref(tab:tab-hist-sites) so the option is available that potential areas of restoration can be ranked according to their proximity to these sites. # # 15. Spatially delineate areas of high fisheries values based on known spawning and rearing habitat for fish species of interest. Where data gaps exist - develop study plans to understand where this high value habitat is and quantify its value for fish species of interest through standardized methodologies such as Fish and Fish Habitat Assessment Procedures [@johnstonFishHabitatAssessment1996]. For known spawning and rearing locations, load reviewed data into `bcfishpass` using the `user_habitat_classification.csv` file located [here](https://github.com/smnorris/bcfishpass/blob/main/data/user_habitat_classification.csv) so it can be pulled into the collaborative GIS project and queried to facilitate priority ranking of areas of high fisheries values.
