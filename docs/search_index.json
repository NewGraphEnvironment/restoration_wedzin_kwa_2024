The Wet’suwet’en people are a matrilineal society organized into the Gilseyhu (Big Frog), Laksilyu (Small Frog), Tsayu (Beaver clan), Gitdumden (Wolf/Bear) and Laksamshu (Fireweed) clans. Within each of the clans there are are a number of kin-based groups known as Yikhs or House groups. The Yikh is a partnership between the people and the territory. Thirteen Yikhs with Hereditary Chiefs manage a total of 38 distinct territories upon which they have jurisdiction. Within a clan, the head Chief is entrusted with the stewardship of the House territory to ensure the Land is managed in a sustainable manner. Inuk Nu’at’en (Wet’suwet’en law) governing the harvesting of fish within their lands are based on values founded on thousands of years of social, subsistence and environmental dynamics. The Yintahk (Land) is the centre of life as well as culture and it’s management is intended to provide security for sustaining salmon, wildlife, and natural foods to ensure the health and well-being of the Wet’suwet’en (Office of the Wet’suwet’en 2013; “Office of the Wet’suwet’en” 2021; FLNRORD 2017). There are a total of six first nation bands that encompass the Wet’suwet’en. These are: Wet’suwet’en, Ts’il Kaz Koh, Hagwilget Village, Nee-Tahi-Buhn Band, Skin Tyee and Witset (“Wet’suwet’en” 2022). 1.2 Widzin Kwah Water Sustainability Project The Widzin Kwah Water Sustainability Project is a joint initiative led by the Office of the Wet’suwet’en and Province of BC, as two governments working together with the goal to develop and recommend for approval new objectives and management direction for the Widzin Kwah. What is known to the Wet’suwet’en as Widzin Kwah is the river called Morice, and means river of clear, blue-green waters. Widzin Kwah includes its starting place where the river flows from its headwaters at Morice Lake (Widzin Bin), to where it meets and joins the Upper Bulkley River (Neexdzii Kwah) and continues as Widzin Kwah until its confluence with the Skeena River near Hazelton BC. The purpose of the Widzin Kwah Water Sustainability Project is for maintaining and improving watershed health (condition) and integrity (function) (“Widzin Kwah Water Sustainability Project” n.d.). 1.3 Widzin Kwah The common english nameing conventions for the Bukley River and Morice Rivers can be confusing since the Neexdzii Kwah (Upper Bulkley River) is actually a tributary to Widzin Kwah (Morice River) providing on average less than a third of it’s flow volumes where it flows in to the much larger system at Houston, BC. Historic nameing of the rivers during colonization resulted in “Bulkley River” being the name chosen for the mainstem of the system flowing from Houston to the confluence with the Skeena River at Hazelton - however - a more accurate colonial name for the system may have been the Morice River with the Upper Bulkley River considered a tributary of another namesake. It is important to recognize that the interpretation of the English names for the Bulkley River, the Upper Bulkley River and the Morice River can misrepresent the reality of flow patterns in the greater watersheds and that by using Wet’suwet’en place names we not only acknowledge the deep connection Wet’suwet’en carry to their clan territories, but also communicate a more accurate interpretation of the geography of the region. More detail regarding the hydrology and fisheries of the Widzin Kwa and the Neexdzii Kwah will be provided in the background section of this document. 1.4 Project Scope 1.4.1 Historic and Ongoing Ecosystem Degradation The Neexdzii Kwah (Upper Bulkley River) has been noted as containing some of the most intense land use in the Skeena Basin predominantly in the form of agriculture, linear development, and forest development activities. Logging, farming, transportation infrastructure, and mining have altered drainage, vegetation and soil properties, leading to changes in water, sediment, and nutrient transportion throughout the watershed. Activities in riparian areas adjacent to rivers and streams, such as deforestation or development, have changed how much sunlight hits the water, impacted the flow of large debris and organic matter, and altered natural river dynamics, including the stability of banks and channels, sediment movement, water flow throughout the seasons, and how floods occur. Cutting off streams from their surrounding floodplains has further disrupted water cycles, nutrient distribution, and the types of plants growing there. Additionally, human actions like the extensive fishing of salmon, as well as the introduction of hatchery salmon, have likely significantly altered salmon population structure to outside of the historic range of variability present pre-colonialization (A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett 2007a). Changes to the climate systems are causing impacts to natural and human systems on all continents with alterations to hydrological systems caused by changing precipitation or melting snow and ice increasing the frequency and magnitude of extreme events such as floods and droughts (Climate Change 2014: Synthesis Report. Geneva, Switzerland: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). 2014; ECCC 2016). These changes are resulting in modifications to the quantity and quality of water resources throughout British Columbia and are likely to compound issues related to drought and flooding in the study area where numerous water licenses are held with a potential over-allocation of flows identified during low flow periods (ILMB 2007). 1.4.2 Project Objectives In partnership with the Morice Water Monitoring Trust, A Rocha, Office of Wet’suwet’en, Fisheries and Oceans Canada and representatives of the Provincial government (all members of the Upper Bulkley Round Table) - low-tech, process-based, watershed restoration activities will be implemented to build upon previous work in the region. Project team members will engage with local land users, land owners and industrial users of the land to collaboratively understand and communicate drivers of ecosystem degradation in the region as well as to work together to stop the degradation while implementing actions intended to improve watershed health. To collaboratively understand the outcomes of past restoration efforts in areas of historic importance to salmon and ecosystem function the following are required: amalgamation and sharing of information regarding past prescriptive restoration actions in the region that may or may not have been implemented, amalgamation of information about past restoration sites, including descriptions of what work was completed, who the land owner was, results of past/current monitoring and what kind of monitoring and maintenance activities may be appropriate in the future, To collaboratively stop the drivers of watershed health degredation and set the stage for actions that can meaningfully improve watershed health - the following are required: identification of overlap between current and historically important fish habitat where riparian vegetation has been removed or degraded and where it may be most effective to restore or protect riparian vegetation to improve habitat values, water quality and quantity, identification of areas where stream channels/floodplain has been altered (ie. channel relocation/straightening, dredging, sediment blockages, etc.) and where it may be important to restore or protect channel morphology to improve fish habitat, water quality and quantity, identification and details of potential barriers to fish passage and subsequent fish passage restoration options, identification of landowners who are interested in participating in conservation and restoration - as well as monitoring and maintenance activities, idenfification of parcels of land that coincide with potentially high value aquatic habitats or areas that have the potential to significantly impact high value aquatic habitats that are publically owned and can be accessed by all without restriction or permission, and identification of potential funding sources for restoration activities and monitoring and maintenance activities that can help maintain stability for a comprehensive program that allows the resources and time necessary to conduct a robust restoration implementation and monitoring program with a scale suitable to address the magnitude of the issues at hand. Physical actions indented to facilitate watershed health improvements can include but are not limited to: rebuilding of riparian structure through cattle exclusion and planting/seeding/maintenance of native vegetation, reconnection of streams to their floodplains disconnected by stream channel incision, historic channel dredgeing, stream realignment, the CN Railway, Highway 16 and other linear transporation infrastructure, remediation of fish passage at potential barriers for migrating adult and juvenile salmon, stabilization of streambanks to prevent erosion, sediment deposition and the loss of riparian vegetation, and mimicking and promoting beaver activity on the landscape to encourage retention of water on the floodplains that will result in the slow release of surface water and recharging of groundwater. Planning and physical actions may require a high degree of outreach and collaboration with interest holders and regulators while prioritizing process-based approaches to restoration which rely on assisting natural river corridor processes over time whenever possible. Effectiveness monitoring and adaptive management will be important components of the work to ensure knowledge is gained through the restoration processes while being carried forward and shared widely to inform future investments. The purpose of this document is to outline watershed restoration initiatives which can be actionable in the future. "],["background.html", "2 Background 2.1 Project Location 2.2 Fisheries 2.3 Restoration Philosophy", " 2 Background 2.1 Project Location The study area primarily focuses on the Neexdzii Kwah (Upper Bulkley River), which is located upstream of the confluence of the Widzin Kwah (Morice River) and the Neexdzii Kwah rivers. Although this area is the initial focus of activities, the overall area for project activities can include anywhere within the boundaries of the Widzin Kwah Water Sustainability Project. The boundaries of the Widzin Kwah Water Sustainability Project include not only the Neexdzii Kwah but also the entire drainage area of Widzin Kwah (Morice River) as well as the small portion of the Bulkley River downstream of the Morice River confluence to just north of Dockrill Creek (“Widzin Kwah Water Sustainability Project” n.d.). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/OW_2024_bulk.png&quot;) 2.1.1 Neexdzii Kwah (Upper Bulkley River) The Neexdzii Kwah (Upper Bulkley River) is an 8th order stream that drains an area of 2320.3 km2 in a generally northerly direction from Bulkley Lake on the Nechako Plateau to its confluence with the Widzin Kwah (Morice River) near Houston (“Widzin Kwah Water Sustainability Project” n.d.). It has a mean annual discharge of 19.2 m3/s at station 08EE003 located near Houston. The hydrograph peaks around May - June during the spring freshet with additional peaks related to significant rain events (Figures 2.1 and 2.2)(Westcott 2022).

Buck Creek is one of the main tributaries to the Neexdzii Kwah and has a mean annual discharge of 4.5 m3/s at station 08EE013 located near the Houston Medical Centre approximately 1 km upstream of the mouth (Westcott 2022). Flows from Buck Creek account for just under 1/3 of the total flows in Neexdzii Kwah.

The Morice River is an 8th order stream that flows approximatley 80km from Widzin Bin (Morice Lake) to the confluence with the upper Bulkley River just north of Houston. Major tributaries include the Nanika River, the Atna River, Gosnell Creek and the Thautil River. There area numerous large lakes situated on the south side of the watershed including Morice Lake, McBride Lake, Stepp Lake, Nanika Lake, Kid Price Lake, Owen Lake and others. There is one active hydrometric station on the mainstem of the Morice River near the outlet of Morice Lake and one historic station that was located at the mouth of the river near Houston that gathered data in 1971 only [@canada2010NationalWater]. An estimate of mean annual discharge for the one year of data available for the Morice near it&#39;s confluence with the Bulkley River is `r round(fasstr::calc_longterm_mean(station_number = &quot;08ED003&quot;)$LTMAD,1)` m^3^/s. Mean annual discharge is estimated at `r round(fasstr::calc_longterm_mean(station_number = &quot;08ED002&quot;)$LTMAD,1)` m^3^/s at station 08ED002 located near the outlet of Morice Lake. Flow patterns are typical of high elevation watersheds influenced by coastal weather patterns which receive large amounts of winter precipitation as snow in the winter and large precipitation events in the fall. This leads to peak levels of discharge during snowmelt, typically from May to July with isolated high flows related to rain and rain on snow events common in the fall (Figures \\@ref(fig:hydrograph4) - \\@ref(fig:hydrology-stats4)). # # ```{r, eval=TRUE} # lfpr_create_hydrograph(&quot;08ED002&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08ED002.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrology_stats_08ED002.png&quot;) 2.2 Fisheries 2.2.1 Neexdzii Kwah Traditionally, the salmon stocks passing through and spawning in the greater Bulkley River were the principal food source for the Gitxsan and Wet’suwet’en people living there (Wilson and Rabnett 2007). Anadromous lamprey passing through and spawning in the upper Neexdzii Kwah were traditionally also an important food source for the Wet’suwet’en (A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett (2007b); pers comm. Mike Ridsdale, Environmental Assessment Coordinator, Office of the Wet’suwet’en). A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett (2007b) report sourceing information from Fisheries and Oceans (1991) that principal spawning areas for chinook in the Neexdzii Kwah include the mainstem above and below Buck and McQuarrie Creeks, between Cesford and Watson Creeks, and the reaches upstream and downstream of Bulkley Falls. Renowned as a world class recreational steelhead and coho fishery, the greater Bulkley River downstream of Neexdzii Kwah receives some of the heaviest angling pressure in the province. In response to longstanding angler concerns with respect to overcrowding, quality of experience and conflict amongst anglers, an Angling Management Plan was drafted for the river following the initiation of the Skeena Quality Waters Strategy process in 2006 and an extensive multi-year consultation process. The plan introduces a number of regulatory measures with the intent to provide Canadian resident anglers with quality steelhead fishing opportunities. Regulatory measures introduced with the Angling Management Plan include prohibited angling for non-guided non-resident aliens on Saturdays and Sundays, Sept 1 - Oct 31 within the Bulkley River, angling prohibited for non-guided non-resident aliens on Saturdays and Sundays, all year within the Suskwa River and angling prohibited for non-guided non-resident aliens Sept 1 - Oct 31 in the Telkwa River. The Neexdzii Kwah is considered Class II water and there is no fshing permitted upstream of the Morice/Bulkley River Confluence (FLNRO 2013a, 2013b; FLNRORD 2019). 2.2.1.1 Upper Bulkley Falls A detailed field assessment and write up regarding the upper Bulkley falls was conducted as part of fish passage restoration in the watershed - is presented in Irvine (2021) with a condensed summary here. The site was assessed on October 28, 2021 by Nallas Nikal, B.i.T, and Chad Lewis, Environmental Technician. The top of the falls is located at 11U.678269.6038266 at an elevation of 697m approximatley 11.3km downstream of Bulkley Lake and upstream of Ailport Creek. Within the Bulkley River immediately below the 12 - 15m high bedrock falls, channel width was 17.4m and the wetted width was 15.6m. Two channels comprised the falls. The primary channel was 20m long, had a channel/wetted width of 8.5m, a 16% grade and water depths ranging from 35 - 63cm. The secondary channel was 25m long, with channel/wetted widths of 7.5m, a grade of 12% and water depths ranging from 3 - 13cm (Irvine 2021). Dyson (1949) and Stokes (1956) report substantial use of habitat above Bulkley Falls by steelhead, chinook, coho and sockeye utilization in the past (pre-1950) based on spawning reports. Both authors concluded that the Bulkley Falls pose a partial obstruction to migrating fish based on flow levels. Chinook, which migrate early in the summer when water levels are high, have been noted as able to ascend the falls in normal to high water years and in high water years it was thought that coho and steelhead could ascend. A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett (2007b) report that the falls are almost completely impassable to all salmon during low water flows. Stokes (1956) reports that there was high value spawning habitat located within the first 3km of the Neexdzii Kwah from the outlet of Bulkley Lake. Wilson and Rabnett (2007) reported thataApproximately 11.3 km downstream of the Bulkley Lake outlet and just upstream of Watson Creek, the upper Bulkley falls is an approximately 4m high narrow rock sill that crosses the Neexdzii Kwah, producing a steep cascade section. This obstacle to fish passage is recorded as an almost complete barrier to fish passage for salmon during low water flows. Wilson and Rabnett (2007) also reported that coho have not been observed beyond the falls since 1972. 2.2.1.2 Traditional Fishing Sites within the Neexdzii Kwah Traditional fishing areas located within the Neexdzii Kwah as documented by Wilson and Rabnett (2007) are detailed in Table 2.1. # Extract historical fishing sites path &lt;- &quot;/Users/airvine/zotero/storage/8SUN8SYA/Wilson and Rabnett - 2007 - Fish Passage Assessment of.pdf&quot; ##define the area to extract table from for first page #you would run with this the first time tab_trim &lt;- tabulizer::locate_areas(path, 64) ##since we have done this before though - numbers below are results # top left bottom right # 70.98383 84.16353 407.17779 521.81754 tab_trim &lt;- list(c(70.98383, 84.16353, 407.17779, 521.81754 )) names_cols &lt;- c(&#39;Site Location&#39;, &#39;Tradional Site Name&#39;, &#39;Fish Species&#39;) ##extract the tables useing the areas you defined table_raw &lt;- tabulizer::extract_tables(path, pages = seq(64,64), method = &quot;lattice&quot;, area = tab_trim) %&gt;% pluck(1) %&gt;% as_tibble() %&gt;% # funky column names so we slice the first row and set them as names slice(2:nrow(.)) %&gt;% dplyr::select(1:3) %&gt;% purrr::set_names(names_cols) ##should do this as input from &quot;pages&quot; part of the function # burn out to csv for safe keeping table_raw %&gt;% readr::write_csv(&#39;data/trad_fish_sites_wilson_rabnett2007FishPassage.csv&#39;) readr::read_csv(&#39;data/trad_fish_sites_wilson_rabnett2007FishPassage.csv&#39;) %&gt;% dplyr::filter(stringr::str_detect(`Site Location`, &quot;Buck|Maxan|McQuarrie|Bulkley Lake|Hwy.16&quot;)) %&gt;% arrange(`Tradional Site Name`) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &quot;Traditional fishing sites in the Neexdzii Kwah.

2019). Summaries of fish species life history, biology, stock status, and traditional use are documented in Schell (2003), Wilson and Rabnett (2007), Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall (2002) and Office of the Wet’suwet’en (2013). Wilson and Rabnett (2007) discuss chinook, pink, sockeye, coho, steelhead and indigenous freshwater Bulkley River fish stocks within the context of key lower and upper Bulkley River habitats such as the Suskwa River, Station Creek, Harold Price Creek, Telkwa River and Buck Creek. Key areas within the upper Bulkley River watershed with high fishery values, documented in Schell (2003), are the upper Bulkley mainstem, Buck Creek, Dungate Creek, Barren Creek, McQuarrie Creek, Byman Creek, Richfield Creek, Johnny David Creek, Aitken Creek and Emerson Creek. Some areas of high fisheries values for chinook, sockeye and coho are noted in Bustard and Schell (2002) as McBride Lake, Nanika Lake, and Morice Lake watersheds. # In the 1990&#39;s the Morice River watershed, @gottesfeldSkeenaFishPopulations2007 estimated that chinook comprised 30% of the total Skeena system chinook escapements. It is estimated that Morice River coho comprise approximatley 4% of the Skeena escapement with a declining trend noted since the 1950 in @gottesfeldSkeenaFishPopulations2007 Coho spawn in major tributaries and small streams ideally at locations where downstream dispersal can result in seeding of prime off channel habitats including warm productive sloughs and side channels. Of all the salmon species, coho rely on small tributaries the most [@bustardConservingMoriceWatershed2002]. @bustardConservingMoriceWatershed2002 report that much of the distribution of coho into non-natal tributaries occurs during high flow periods of May - early July with road culverts blocking migration into these habitats. fiss_species_table &lt;- readr::read_csv(&#39;data/extracted_inputs/fiss_species_table.csv&#39;) fiss_species_table %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Fish species recorded in the Bulkley River and Morice River watershed groups.&#39;, footnote_text = &#39;COSEWIC abbreviations : SC - Special concern DD - Data deficient NAR - Not at risk E - Endangered T - Threatened BC List definitions : Yellow - Species that is apparently secure Blue - Species that is of special concern Exotic - Species that have been moved beyond their natural range as a result of human activity &#39;, scroll = gitbook_on) Table 2.4: Fish species recorded in the Bulkley River and Morice River watershed groups.

Together, these processes shape rivers and flood planes, which is known as a riverscape (Shahverdian et al. 2019). The goal of process-based restoration is to restore these processes to their the natural rates and magnitudes (essentially stage 0), which leads to the system restoring itself through biological processes and requires minimal corrective intervention Polvi and Wohl (2013). This approach is in contrast to traditional river restoration, which focuses on restoring uniform and static form to the river, such as the channel shape, and is often done through hard engineering and has high costs (Beechie et al. 2010). Principles of process-based restoration adapted from Beechie et al. (2010) are included in Table 2.5. restoration_principles_pb %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = restoration_principles_pb_caption, scroll = gitbook_on) Table 2.5: Principles of process-based restoration adapted from Beechie et al. (2010). Developed with the aid of GPT-4 as tracked in this link https://chat.openai.com/share/fb0de9b0-0d79-40f8-aec4-a35ac14c1164. Principle Description Target root causes of habitat and ecosystem change Aim at the main factors causing ecosystem decline. Identify and try to reverse the impact of human activities on natural processes. Tailor restoration actions to local potential Each section of a river or stream has its own set of natural features due to its geographic location and climate. Design restoration efforts to align with these inherent characteristics. Match the scale of restoration to the scale of the problem The restoration effort should correspond to the extent of the issue. Localized problems, such as removal of vegetation by a riverbank, need targeted solutions. However, broader impacts like floodplain alteration due to railways, highways, and intensive farming, require numerous actions across the area. Restoring habitats for species that traverse large areas needs planning that covers their entire living range. Be explicit about expected outcomes Restoring natural areas is a slow process, and it may take time to see the results. Natural ecosystems are always changing, and a single project might not lead to immediate, noticeable improvements. Setting clear, measurable goals is crucial for understanding the impact of restoration efforts. Below is an example of process-based restoration using stage 0 methodology done at Deer Creek in Oregon, USA. In this project they filled in incised channels and added large wood to to the river to restore the natural floodplain elevation and re-establish multiple channels (Figure 2.5)(Meyer 2018). Although this project used relatively aggressive restoration techniques, they observed immediate improvements and the benefits were self-sustaining (Figure 2.6)(Meyer 2018). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/stage0_before_after.png&quot;) Figure 2.5: An example of process-based restoration using stage 0 methodology to restored the natural floodplain elevation. In this project they filled in incised channels and added large wood to restore the natural floodplain elevation and re-establish multiple channels (Meyer, 2018). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/deer_creek_before_after.png&quot;) Figure 2.6: Before and after restoration took place at Deer Creek, USA. They observed imediate improvements to the habitat and the benefits were self-sustaining (Meyer, 2018). Process-based restoration also includes many low-cost and low-tech restoration techniques. Resources are sourced from near-by areas, and the restoration is often done by hand, which makes it more accessible to a broad audience and can be done on a smaller scale (Shahverdian et al. 2019). The primary goal of low-tech restoration is to improve the health of as many riverscapes possible by “letting the system do the work” (Shahverdian et al. 2019). Low-cost process-based restoration could be an applicable in the Upper Bulkely riverscape. Some examples of low-cost restoration techniques include: Grazing management Riparian planting Post-assisted log structures (PALS) Beaver damn analogs (BDAs) Further examples of low-cost process-based restoration are available here. 2.3.2 Stage 0 The Stream Evolution Model (SEM) is used to understanding how the morphology of channels (such as rivers or streams) respond to disturbances like changes in base level, channelization, or alterations in flow and sediment regimes (Figure 2.7)(Cluer and Thorne 2014). An important features of the SEM is the inclusion of stage 0, which represents the state of the river before disturbances and is categorized as either an anastomosing wet woodland or an anastomosing grassed wetland (Figure 2.7)(Cluer and Thorne 2014). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/SEM_stages.png&quot;) Figure 2.7: Cluer and Thorne’s (2014) stream evolution model which introduced stage 0, a stage that represents the state of the river before disturbances. The SEM also assigns a hydrogeomorphic attributes and habitat and ecosystem benefits score to each stage (Figure 2.8). Stage 0 is the ultimate restoration goal, but the SEM suggests that there is a big difference in performance between disconnected and incised streams (stages 3-6) and connected streams (stages 7-1), and that stages 7-1 are the best targets for restoration because they have the highest ecosystem potential (Figure 2.8)(Cluer and Thorne 2014). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/SEM_hab_ben.png&quot;) Figure 2.8: Habitat and ecosystem benifits as well as hydrogeomorphic attributes associated with each stage of the SEM, suggesting that stages 7-1 have the highest ecosystem potential (Cluer and Thorne, 2014). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/benefits.png&quot;) Figure 2.9: Examples of how a stage 0 stream can benifit the entire riverscape and play an important role in the biophysical interactions between organisms (Hauer et al., 2016). "],["methods.html", "3 Methods 3.1 Collaborative GIS Environment 3.2 Open Source - Iterative Reporting 3.3 Past Restoration Initiative Identification 3.4 Future Restoration Site Selection", " 3 Methods 3.1 Collaborative GIS Environment Geographical Information Systems are essential for developing and communicating restoration plans as well as the reasons they are required and how they are developed. Without the ability to visualize the landscape and the data that is used to make decisions it is difficult to conduct and communicate the need for restoration, the details of past and future plans as well as and the potential results of physical works. To facilitate the planning and implementation of restoration activities in the Neexdzii Kwah (and elsewhere within the Widzin Kwah Water Sustainability Project area), a collaborative GIS environment (titled restoration_wedzin_kwa) has been established using QGIS and Mergin Maps (source code here. This environment is intended to be a space where project team members can access and view and contribute to the amalgamation of background spatial data and the development of restoration as well as monitoring for the project. The collaborative GIS environment allows users to view, edit, and analyze shared up to date spatial data on personal computers in an office setting as well as phones and tablets in the field. At the time of reporting, the environment was being used to develop and share maps, conduct spatial analyses, communicate restoration plans to stakeholders as well as to provide a central place to store methodologies and tools for conducting field assessments on standardized pre-developed digital forms. The platform can also be used to track the progress of restoration activities and monitor changes in the landscape over time helping encourage the record keeping of past and future restoration activities in a coordinated manner. The shared QGIS project was created using scripts currently kept in dff-2022 with the precise calls to project creation scripts tracked in the project_creation_and_permissions.txt document kept in the main QGIS project directory. Information about how GIS project creation and update scripts function can be viewed here with outcomes of their use summarized below: download and clip user specified layers from the BC Data Catalougue as well as data layers stored in custom Amazon Web Services buckets for an area of interest defined by a list of watershed groups and load to a geopackage called background_layers.gpkg stored in the main directory of the project. An additional lateral_habitat.tiff layer is also clipped to the user defined area and loaded to the project. A project directory is created to hold the spatial data and QGIS project information (ie. layer symbology and naming conventions, metadata, etc.). Metadata for individual project spatial layers is kept in the rfp_tracking table within the background_layers.gpkg along with tables related to user supplied stream width/gradient inputs to bcfishpass to model potentially high value habitat that is accessible to fish species of interest. ## QRis # [QGIS Riverscapes Studio](https://qris.riverscapes.net/) (QRis) is a free plugin for QGIS that helps you digitize your riverscape data. QRis is a great planning tool for helping users with spatial representation of riverscapes. # # QRis has two distinct types of features: # # * Static: These are features that are relatively permanent, such as the valley bottom. # * Dynamic: These are features that change over time, such as the active channel. # # QRis will be a useful tool for digitizing the upper Wetzin&#39;kwa river and prioritizing restoration sites. To start using QRis, follow the instructions for [getting started](https://qris.riverscapes.net/getting-started/). 3.2 Open Source - Iterative Reporting A key question we have been asking ourselves is: “What is the most useful way to present information?” From our perspective - the most useful way to present information is in a version controlled format that allows it to be interactive, reproducible, read online, served out as a static document, updated, copied, used as a template, etc. Iterative reporting, managed with a version control system such as git (see example of tracking edits here) with a permissive license is a great way to do all those things. Although there is a steep learning curve to using programming tools and producing this type of product and although it can be quite time consuming - it then allows leveraging of all the components of the work to future projects for everyone. Licensing is also key for work to be shared. MIT License is an example of a license that promotes collaboration and sharing/leveraging of work while. From our perspective - restoration planning are the type of initiatives that are well suited to an iterative reporting format such as can be demonstrated within this code repository which builds and serves this online report. 3.2.1 Issue and Discussion Tracking Issues and discussions are effective ways to track tasks, enhancements, and bugs for the project. Issues can be used to keep track of all the things that need to be done, and can be used to discuss in-line with references to code used to address them linked to the issues through git commit messages. Issues for this project are kept here and discussions are kept here. 3.2.2 Tables and Figures There are many tables within this document that can take a long time to format. Within this document the tables have been imported often as simple csv files or pages of an excel workbook and pulled into the project using scripts. This allows others to access the data and use it in their own projects. These tables can also then be easily updated with new data as it becomes available often with the formatting for presentation to reader handled by the scripting. An example of this can be seen here in Table 3.1 with the actual file served here: read_csv(&quot;data/aquatic_restoration_resources.csv&quot;) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &quot;Aquatic Restoration Resources.&quot;) Table 3.1: Aquatic Restoration Resources.

An example of this can be seen here Table 3.1 with the actual file served here. 3.2.3 Data Sourceing from Skeena Salmon Data Centre Whenever possible we have attempted to tie into existing data govenment infrastructure in the Skeena region by downloading data directly from the Skeena Salmon Data Centre using the application programming interface to their CKAN database. To facilitate and simlify this process we developed a function to download data from the CKAN database and load it into local versions of the project repository. This fetch_package function is kept in the scripts/functions.R file of the project and can be used to download entire “packages” of data from the Skeena Salmon Data Centre. 3.2.4 Documentation of Workflows Select workflows were documented in memo format to illustrate the process used for others and promote reproducibility/leverageing of Neexdzii Kwah.

A wealth of information is present for the Neexdzii Kwah however it is located in many different locations and not always spatially represented. To address this, a comprehensive review of past restoration activities is underway. This review included a review of the literature, interviews with local experts, and a review of the restoration prescriptions and activities that have been conducted in the Neexdzii Kwah. For information regarding relatively recent restoration efforts such as physical works conducted through Healthy Watersheds Initiative, representatives from the Morice Watershed Monitoring Trust amalgamated all information located on physical drives and either provided emails with the data attached or provided links to the data for the study team for download and review. This information was then subsequently downloaded and re-uploaded to a OneDrive folder for the study team to access. 3.4 Future Restoration Site Selection 3.4.1 Fish Passage At the time of writing, extensive work related to fish passage restoration planning was underway in the Neexdzii Kwah watershed as well as other areas of the greater Skeena watershed. Methodology for this work is presented in A. Irvine (2023), Irvine (2022) and Irvine (2021). Although these references detail work related to linear connectivity (ie. upstream/downstream) there is ongoing work related to lateral connnectivity (ie. floodplain connectivity) with methodology realted to disconnections due to the railway documented in bcfishpass (Norris 2024) here. The results of this analysis and future analysis incorporating major roadways as well (currently under development) will be added to the shared QGIS project and used to inform future restoration activity prioritization. 3.4.2 Local Knowledge for Riparian Area and Erosion Protection Site Selection To facilitate project activities in the short term - the project team will select among some known areas of riparian removal and bank erosion where landowners are amenable to project activities including installation of cattle exclusion fencing and riparian planting in the next two fiscal years. 3.4.3 Evaluation of Historic and Current Imagery Evaluation of historic and current imagery to understand and quantify morphological changes in the Neexdzii Kwah and its major tributaries over time and guide future restoration efforts. This will require that the study team acquire, georeference, archive and analyze historic imagery for the Neexdzii Kwah watershed and compare with an analysis of recent LiDAR data to quantify historic changes in stream morphology resulting in loss of quantity and quality of water and fish habitat. Through this process we hope to highlight areas of historic dredging, realignment, and floodplain disconnections due to infrastructure that have degraded watershed health and fish habitat. 3.4.4 Delineation of Areas of High Fisheries Values Spatially delineate areas of high fisheries values based on modelled and known spawning and rearing habitat for fish species of interest. Project team members have mentioned that there was work done in the past to spatially delineate areas of high value habitat for chinook and potentially sockeye salmon. This data will hopefully be aquired. Additionally background literature includes some decriptions of traditional Wet’suwet’en Fisheries sites which can be spatialized for the project. 3.4.5 Parameter Ranking to Select Future Restoration Sites Analysis of background and current data will be used to inform priority ranking criteria used to select sites for restoration activities in the long term. Although this has not yet been conducted - included in this process can be: GIS and user input parameters were selected based on project team meetings and review of available spatial information to rank future restoration sites. Whenever possible standardized names for layers (schema and table) and fields were used to facilitate the reproducibility of similiar analysis on other or updated datasets, both by ourselves and by others.

Records from the following datasets have been included: The Fisheries Information Summary System (FISS); the Fish Habitat Inventory and Information Program (FHIIP); the Field Data Information System (FDIS) and the Resource Analysis Branch (RAB) inventory studies. The main intent of this layer is to have a single layer of all known obstacles to fish passage. It is important to note that not all waterbodies have been studied and, not all lengths of many waterbodies have been studied so there are a very high number of obstacles in the real world that are not recorded in this dataset. This layer simply reports the obstacles to fish that are known. It is also very important to note that we are acknowledging these features as obstacles to fish passage versus barriers to fish passage. This is because an obstacle may be a barrier at one time of year but not at other times depending on the volume of water present and also, what is a barrier to one species of fish is not necessarily a barrier to another species. whse_fish.fiss_stream_sample_sites_sp https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/e616864b-8991-42d1-a2f9-4d4402c32be8 This spatial layer displays stream inventory sample sites that have had full or partial surveys, and contains measurements or indicator information of the data collected at each survey site on each date. whse_fish.pscis_assessment_svw https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/7ecfafa6-5e18-48cd-8d9b-eae5b5ea2881 Points where a fish passage assessment has been performed on a stream crossing structure.

Design points have been identified as a priority for remediation based on a variety of potential criteria: quality of habitat upstream, quantity of fish habitat upstream, number and importance of species present, operational plans for the road cost of the proposed remediation, etc. They are sites where the amount of habitat to be gained by remediation has been confirmed and where a design has actually been completed. whse_fish.pscis_habitat_confirmation_svw https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/572595ab-0a25-452a-a857-1b6bb9c30495 Points where an evaluation of the fish habitat up and downstream of a road crossing have been carried out. Phase 2 of 4 in the Fish Passage Workflow, Habitat Confirmations are done at sites where the crossing structure is known to be a failure. The Habitat Confirmation is performed to ensure that the site in question is a good candidate for moving on to the Design (Phase 3) and Remediation (Phase 4) stages of the workflow. The Habitat Confirmation confirms the crossing is a barrier, places the crossing in context with respect to other roads and crossings in the watershed and also quantifies and qualifies how much habitat will be gained if the site is fixed. whse_fish.pscis_remediation_svw https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/1596afbf-f427-4f26-9bca-d78bceddf485 Points where a barrier to fish passage has been rectified or remediated.

Burn severity mapping is conducted using best available pre- and post-fire satellite multispectral imagery acquired by the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) aboard the Sentinel-2 satellite or the Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor aboard the Landsat-8 and 9 satellites. The post-fire imagery is acquired during the subsequent growing season. Mapping conducted during the subsequent growing season benefits from greater post-fire image availability and is expected to be more representative of tree mortality. Every attempt is made to use cloud, smoke, shadow and snow-free imagery that was acquired prior to September 30th. Please note, this layer is 1-year-later burn severity dataset. The same-year burn severity mapping dataset (WHSE_FOREST_VEGETATION.VEG_BURN_SEVERITY_SAME_YR_SP) is considered an interim product to this layer. 4.1.0.1 Methodology: • Select suitable pre- and post-fire imagery or create a cloud/snow/smoke-free composite from multiple images scenes • Calculate normalized burn severity ratio (NBR) for pre- and post-fire images • Calculate difference NBR (dNBR) where dNBR = pre NBR – post NBR • Apply a scaling equation (dNBR_scaled = dNBR*1000 + 275)/5) • Apply BARC thresholds (76, 110, 187) to create a 4-class image (unburned, low severity, medium severity, and high severity) • Apply region-based filters to reduce noise • Confirm burn severity analysis results through visual quality control • Produce a vector dataset and apply Euclidian distance smoothing whse_forest_vegetation.veg_comp_lyr_r1_poly https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/2ebb35d8-c82f-4a17-9c96-612ac3532d55 Geospatial forest inventory dataset updated for depletions, such as harvesting, and projected annually for growth.

In the event of a discrepancy in the data, the metes and bounds description will prevail. Although the boundaries were drawn based on the legal metes and bounds descriptions, they may differ from how regional districts and their member municipalities and electoral areas currently view and/or manage their boundaries. Where discrepancies are noted, the Ministry of Municipal Affairs (the custodian) enters into discussion with the local governments whose boundaries are affected. In order to effect a change to the boundary, Cabinet approval is required. This is done through an Order in Council (OIC). While discrepancies to administrative boundaries are being resolved, boundaries may be adjusted on an ongoing basis until the requested changes are completed. The OIC_YEAR and OIC_NUMBER fields indicate the year that the boundary was passed under OIC and its associated number.

Neexdzii Kwah watershed will help ensure that the restoration activities address the underlying drivers of the degradation necessitating restoration. Understanding of the drivers of the degredation will require intensive field assessments, the use of GIS that incorperates all data possible, incorperation of background information and amalgamation of local knowledge. The following recommendations are provided to try to ensure that the restoration activities are effective and address the underlying drivers of the degredation. At the time of writing this can be considered a partial list as the project is still in development and the recommendations are subject to change as the project progresses. The recommendations to date are as follows: Spatially represent past prescriptions in the watershed where information is available. NCFDC (1998) prescriptions have been extracted from their report and are presented in Table 4.4. These prescriptions can be loaded into the collaborative GIS project and reviewed collaboratively to understand historic priority ranking, reevaluate the utility of the work 30 years later and help feed into adaptive management where restoration actions were persued. Spatially represent historic fisheries sites presented in Table 2.1 so the option is available that potential areas of restoration can be ranked according to their proximity to these sites. Spatially delineate areas of high fisheries values based on known spawning and rearing habitat for fish species of interest. Where data gaps exist - develop study plans to understand where this high value habitat is and quantify its value for fish species of interest through standardized methodologies such as Fish and Fish Habitat Assessment Procedures (Johnston and Slaney 1996). For known spawning and rearing locations, load reviewed data into bcfishpass using the user_habitat_classification.csv file located here. Information can then be pulled into the collaborative GIS project and queried to facilitate priority ranking of areas of high fisheries values. Acquire, georeference, archive (within SKT) and analyze historic aerial imagery for the Neexdzii Kwah watershed and compare with recent orthoimagery and/or LiDAR data to quantify historic changes in stream morphology resulting in loss of quantity and quality of water and fish habitat while highlighting areas of historic dredging, realignment, and floodplain disconnections due to infrastructure, to guide future restoration efforts. Script all analysis when possible to facilitate reproducibility and sharing of the analysis. Further refine parameters (GIS and user input) to select future restoration sites and develop a ranking system for each of the parameters to aid in the prioritization of future sites. Whenever possible, develop and share open-source workflows to extract ranking parameters from datasets unaltered from their original sources to facilitate the reproducibility of similiar analysis on other or updated datasets, both by ourselves and by others. Continue to develop and document data management workflows to leverage existing established data storage systems to retrieve data from and load too and build capacity for all interested to do the same. Established data storage systems include the BC Data Catalogue, the Skeena Salmon Data Centre, NuSEDS-New Salmon Escapement Database System (example of .html file that can be downloaded here and opened in browser such as Chrome - double click - https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/restoration_wedzin_kwa_2024/tree/main/memos) and bcfishpass Develop criteria for minimal setbacks required for cattle exclusion and riparian restoration based on the ecosystem services provided by the riparian area and the potential for the area to provide habitat for fish species of interest. Utilize established standards when possible such as the Riparian Areas Protection Regulation and the Riparian Management Area Guidebook (Ministry of Forests 1995). Amalgamate drone acquired ortho-imagery gathered for sites in the Neexdzii Kwah watershed, store as Cloud Optimized Geotiffs on a cloud service provider and link to the imagery via the collaborative GIS project. Orthoimagery has been gathered for past monitoring of historic restoration sites as well as part of fish passage restoration planning efforts. Amalgamate past effectiveness monitoring information and present within online reporting to facilitate leveraging foward of this information through sharing and review. Link historic and potential future sites to the freshwater atlas using the linear feature id of stream segments and conduct watershed drainage area analysis for individual stream segments (or portions of steram segments) so that this area can be tied to other GIS and user input parameters. Functions kept in fwapg, fwapgr, fwatlasbc and custom function developed for this project can be used. Results from this can be compared to other methods for determining project setbacks from the high water mark such as the Riparian Areas Protection Regulation and the Riparian Management Area Guidebook (Ministry of Forests 1995). Develop a monitoring plan for the Neexdzii Kwah watershed restoration works that incorporates and can leverage past monitoring methodology and data but and also includes an updated monitoring schedule, monitoring objectives, and methods. Methodology using Watershed Restoration Procedures - Routine effectiveness evaluation procedures and riparian inventory techniques (LMH25 - percent cover by structural stage, species composition, etc.) could be utilized using pre-built digital forms served to field teams from the collaborative GIS project.
