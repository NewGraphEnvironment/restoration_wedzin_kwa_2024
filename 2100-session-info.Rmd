# Session Info {-}

Information about the computing environment is important for reproducibility. A summary of the computing environment 
is saved to `session_info.csv` that can be viewed and downloaded from `r paste0(params$repo_url, "session_info.csv")`.

```{r session info, comment="", class.source = 'fold-show'}

if(gitbook_on){
  devtools::session_info(to_file = 'session_info.csv')
} else {
  devtools::session_info()
}
```
