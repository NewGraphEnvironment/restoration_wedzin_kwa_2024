## Collaborative GIS Environment

A summary of background information layers loaded to the `background_layers.gpkg` geopackage of the `restoration_wedzin_kwa` project at the time of writing are included in Table \@ref(tab:tab-rfp-tracking).

```{r rfp-tracking-copy, eval = gis_update}
# first we will copy the doc from the Q project to this repo - the location of the Q project is outside of the repo!!
q_path_stub <- "~/Projects/gis/restoration_wedzin_kwa/"

rfp_tracking_raw <- sf::st_read(paste0(q_path_stub, "background_layers.gpkg"),
            layer = "rfp_tracking",
            quite = TRUE)

# grab the metadata

# remove the `_vw` from the end of content

## Past Restoration Initiatives

Information amalgamated from past restoration initiatives has been added to the `restoration_wedzin_kwa` project in spatial formats through the `sites_restoration.gpkg` with details of source document locations, geometry type, description of the source document amalgamated, etc. documented in the `sites_restoration_gpkg_tracking.csv` file located [here](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/restoration_wedzin_kwa_2024/blob/main/data/sites_restoration_gpkg_tracking.csv).

### Works in Progress
@ncfdc1998 utilized detailed fish and fish habitat assessments to inform restoration planning in the Neexdzii Kwah
with numerous detailed prescriptions included within their reporting and digital deliverables. Unfortunately, the
digital deliverables could not be recovered.  Their work persists in pdf format however with summarized details of 
their prioritization work and prescription locations extracted from the pdf and included in the `ncfdc_1998_prescriptions_raw.csv` file located and viewable [here](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/restoration_wedzin_kwa_2024/blob/main/data/ncfdc_1998_prescriptions_raw.csv).  The prioritization table for sub-basins in the region are included in Table \@ref(tab:tab-ncfdc-1998-priority). Next steps for this dataset include mining of prescription locations and addition to the csv so that it can be converted to a spatial file and added to the `restoration_wedzin_kwa` project through the `sites_restoration.gpkg`.

```{r tab-ncfdc-1998-priority}
ncfdc_1998_71a %>% 
  fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = "Table 71a from the NCFDC 1998 report - summary of the prioritization of sub-basins in the Neexdzii Kwah region.",
                 scroll = FALSE)

## GIS parameters to Rank Future Restoration Sites

A summary of an initial draft of GIS and user input parameters used to rank future restoration sites generated from the `restoration_site_priority_parameters.csv` file located [here](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/restoration_wedzin_kwa_2024/blob/main/data/restoration_site_priority_parameters.csv) is included in Table \@ref(tab:tab-gis-params).
