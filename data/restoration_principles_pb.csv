Principle,Description
Target root causes of habitat and ecosystem change,"Concentrate on the primary reasons behind the decline in ecosystem health, identifying human-induced disruptions and working towards remedying them."
Tailor restoration actions to local potential,"Each section of a river or stream has its own natural state, influenced by its location and climate. Design restoration efforts to realign with these natural conditions, leveraging local knowledge for effective interventions."
Match the scale of restoration to the scale of the problem,"Adjust the scope of restoration to the extent of the issue. Localized problems, like altered riverbanks, need specific solutions. Larger-scale disruptions, such as floodplain alterations from railways, highways, and intensive farming, require coordinated actions across the affected area. For species that cover broad territories, planning should encompass their entire habitat."
Be explicit about expected outcomes,"Ecosystem restoration is a long-term commitment, with progress often becoming visible only after some time. Natural changes will continue, and improvements may unfold gradually. Setting clear goals and regularly measuring progress is vital for aligning expectations and tracking the effectiveness of restoration efforts."
