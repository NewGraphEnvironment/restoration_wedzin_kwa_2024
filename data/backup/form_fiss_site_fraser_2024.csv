There are large amounts of invasive weeds, including Canada, Thistle and common Tansey, however.

Above the cut bank is a mix of agronomic grasses, willow and invasive to the fence line located approximately 8 to 20 m from the top of slope.

The site is located proximately 200 m upstream of the lower mud river bridge over the Chilako river. Was apparently a collaboration with transportation. There are three distinct sections of the site overall with the current peace documented here being primarily Riprap. There’s no peg boarding in this centre section. It is mostly rip off with extensive amounts of willow cuttings placed into the rock during construction as well as large amount of small Woody debris at the bottom of the slope corner. There is essentially no right revegetation beyond the top slope in the section likely because the paved road is immediately adjacent to the other side of the ditch beside the fence line at the top of slope. Extensive colonization in this area with Canada Thistle and agronomic grasses.

 On the face of the vegetated riprap slope, there is very good shrub colonization from the cuttings placed within the rock, particularly for the lower half of the slope. For the lower half of the slope is estimated at 35% however Survey was conducted late in the growing season, so likely underestimates the amount of cover at full bloom.

This is the downstream end of a large amount of work done on the outside left bend of the site located hundred to 400 m downstream of the lower mud river road bridge over the Chilako River

This area was peg, boarded with cottonwood and birch potentially other species of logs at approximately 25 to 40 cm DVH keyed into a slope bank that was subsequently buried with soils that were pulled back in the reshaping process.

Although no large runoff events have occurred since installation of the site appears to be holding up very well. Some recolonization of placed willow cuttings. Percent cover of native is roughly estimated at 4%. At the top of the cut slope. It is difficult to determine if vegetation efforts were conducted as, the area is primarily agronomic, grasses, and herbaceous cover. There is some common however, generally Canada Thistle does not seem to be present. There are occasional willow shrubs regenerating on the top of bank and the recurring available for vegetation is significant and estimated at 30 m at the topupstream side and 50 m at the downstream end.
