BR1-2021,2024-09-28,HWI,Yes,yes,,Impressive willow growth in area of bank that has been reshaped and pegboarded.  Low densities/cover percentage of planted riparian shrubs due to dense agronomic sods at the top of bank. UAV flight was conducted in 2023.         
BR2-2021,2024-09-28,HWI,Yes,yes,,Site appears to be holding up well with no slumping occurring.  As with the adjacent BR1 site - willow growth along sloped areas very good.  Low densities/cover percentage of planted riparian shrubs due to dense agronomic sods at the top of bank.  (appears to be reed canary grass but should be confirmed).  UAV flight was conducted in 2023                    
BR5,2024-09-29,HWI,Yes,yes,,"Overall site appears to be relatively stable with some isolated areas of erosion.  Structures in decent shape however, the riparian regeneration is very poor with very small conifers and near all shrub and cottonwood not surviving.  Recommend the area of riparian enhancement be enlarged to provide more meaningful complexity and inputs for the coming 100 years.  Suggest extending out a minimum of 30m from top of bank."
Meints_01,2024-10-02,,Yes,no,yes,"Potential site.  Left bank meander. Silty clay soils with significant incision and large amounts of erosion. Oxbox is ~150m  downstream from site so risk that water will eventually blow through corner and straighten river at this location.  Small beaver dam  upstream.
"
Mickilligan Road Upper,2024-10-02,Gaboury and Smith (2016); Smith and Gaboury (2016),Yes,yes,,"14 large Woody debris and boulder keyboard structures on left bank meander of the Bulkley river. Three of the wooden structures have completely failed and have been carried down the river. Significant amounts of erosion has taken place since works were conducted in 2016 or 17. Generally poor redden vegetation establishment and very narrow buffer between edges structures and cat exclusion, fencing.  Large beaver dam, approximately 60 cm in height located approximately 50 m upstream of the top rock growing.                  "
Mckilligan Rd middle,2024-10-03,Gaboury and Smith (2016),Yes,no,,"Potential site.  This was a site visited and brought forward by Andy Mienst.  It appears to be an area of cattle access to the river, which has caused excessive trampling of the banks.  It’s an outside left bend of the Bulkley River with some erosion.          "
bulkley_wilson_01,2024-09-23,,Yes,no,yes,Upstream Wilson site on left bank corner where access to hay field pinches.   Natural riparian adjacent is a mix of willow and young cottonwood with a few spruce young and is located approximately 20 m from the current eroded bank. Landowner has reported that he could move the road to much further away to access the field in behind. This would allow the current riparian to help protect the bank as erosion progresses.          
bulkley_wilson_02,2024-09-23,,,no,yes,Log jam on right bank with mature old growth cottonwood forest on downstream end and young cottonwood forest and willow comprising riparian upstream.  Landowner reports that stream floods adjacent field to the north almost every year with 2023 and 2024 being exceptions.  Landowner reports that the logjam began approximately six years ago and with one or two logs and is now approximately 70 or 80 full-size pieces of wood.  Point of concern for erosion is on downstream end near 90° corner where log jam is located.          
bulkley_wilson_03,2024-09-23,,No,no,yes,Right bank of river located downstream of Wilson residence.  Very fine clay is undercutting the bank with extensive erosion. Just upstream is section of river highlighted as important chinook habitat by sources from the toboggan hatchery in the past.          
bulkley_meints_craker_rd_upper,2024-09-23,Gaboury and Smith (2016),Yes,no,,Adjacent to Craker Road. Prescription from WFN/LGL not implemented at this site in 2017. Old van in the river at this location. Cottonwood snag across entire wetted channel width. Right bank of the river with less pronounced erosion than many other sites.          
bulkley_meints_craker_rd_middle,2024-09-23,Gaboury and Smith (2016),Yes,no,,WFN/LGL site prescription location but not implemented. Right Bank of river where erosion and flows appears to potentially be the slower than other sections of stream.  Deep water with some large wood debris out in the middle of the channel.                             
bulkley_meints_craker_rd_lower,2024-09-23,Gaboury and Smith (2016),Yes,yes,,WFN/LGL implementated prescription site.  Six LWD structures and some rock armouring.  Bank appears to be stable.  No fencing. Some deep pools scoured behind lower structures.  Decent cottonwood regeneration at downstream end of site with willow dispersed with agronomic grasses and Canada thistle.  Upper end of site with poor riparian generation besides a narrow strip of willow.   
chilako_mud1_upper,2024-10-05,,,,,"Recording site here as a place to document site visit to inform Upper Bulkley Streamkeepers. Upper site is rock and peg boarding. Mix with soil placed on top of re-sloped bank. Although high flow events apparently have not happened in the spring since construction. The site seems to be holding up extremely well. Revegetation on the face of the slope is decent with willow growth and Cottonwood fairly significant had an estimated 5% of the cover. There are large amounts of invasive weeds, including Canada, Thistle and common Tansey, however.

Above the cut bank is a mix of agronomic grasses, willow and invasive to the fence line located approximately 8 to 20 m from the top of slope. Seems unlikely that native shrubs planted will eventually dominate cover above the top bank. Planting on the slope would also likely result in better cover in the long term."
chilako_mud1_bridge,2024-10-05,,,yes,,"This is a place to record erosion protection site as part of Upper Bulkley Streamkeepers restoration planning. This is the downstream site immediately upstream of the lower mud river Road bridge over the lower Chillo river. This site was completed by MOTI and is primarily riprap only. There is some, very small amount of shrub regrowth within the rock and evidence of some cutting placement in the rock however, cover is very minimal and estimated less than one percent. Above the bank and rock placement appears to be highly compacted with some grass growth and occasional stunted, shrubs, and small conifers"
chilako_mud1_middle,2024-10-05,,,yes,,"Site recorded as place to store information regarding thanks stabilization related to Upper Bulkley Streamkeepers. The site is located proximately 200 m upstream of the lower mud river bridge over the Chilako river. Was apparently a collaboration with transportation. There are three distinct sections of the site overall with the current peace documented here being primarily Riprap. There’s no peg boarding in this centre section. It is mostly rip off with extensive amounts of willow cuttings placed into the rock during construction as well as large amount of small Woody debris at the bottom of the slope corner. There is essentially no right revegetation beyond the top slope in the section likely because the paved road is immediately adjacent to the other side of the ditch beside the fence line at the top of slope. Extensive colonization in this area with Canada Thistle and agronomic grasses.

 On the face of the vegetated riprap slope, there is very good shrub colonization from the cuttings placed within the rock, particularly for the lower half of the slope. For the lower half of the slope is estimated at 35% however Survey was conducted late in the growing season, so likely underestimates the amount of cover at full bloom. As noted the top half of the slope contains very minimal shrub and natural colonization percent cover estimated at 5%"
chilako_mud1_lower,2024-10-05,,,yes,," Place to keep information regarding erosion protection related to upper Pokley restoration planning.

This is the downstream end of a large amount of work done on the outside left bend of the site located hundred to 400 m downstream of the lower mud river road bridge over the Chilako River

This area was peg, boarded with cottonwood and birch potentially other species of logs at approximately 25 to 40 cm DVH keyed into a slope bank that was subsequently buried with soils that were pulled back in the reshaping process.

Although no large runoff events have occurred since installation of the site appears to be holding up very well. Some recolonization of placed willow cuttings. Percent cover of native is roughly estimated at 4%. At the top of the cut slope. It is difficult to determine if vegetation efforts were conducted as, the area is primarily agronomic, grasses, and herbaceous cover. There is some common however, generally Canada Thistle does not seem to be present. There are occasional willow shrubs regenerating on the top of bank and the recurring available for vegetation is significant and estimated at 30 m at the topupstream side and 50 m at the downstream end.

          "
kenneth_ds,2024-10-07,,,yes,,Place to put observations as part of upper Bally recovery planning. This is a highway erosion protection site approximately 50 m downstream of the culvert over Kenneth Creek. Primarily riprap bank protection with two boulder large Woody debris structures placed in stream and very minimal vegetation within the riprap within the bottom 2 m of the slope. Some willow and potentially natural Cottonwood regeneration within the bottom 2 m of the slope. There is no meaningful vegetation to provide inputs cover or future large debris complexity to the stream.          
Foxy Maxan Confluence,2025-06-19,Gottesfeld and Rabnett (2007),Yes,,yes,"Right bank of Foxy Creek just upstream of the confluence with Maxan Creek.  Eroding bank elevated 1.3 - 2m in depth of incision.

Beyond approximately 30m from bank is a mature mixed trembling aspen and spruce forest.  Adjacent to where the erosion is occurring is a nicely regenerating area with numerous black cottonwood and trembling aspen trees from 0.7 m to 2.5 m in height.          "
buc7,2025-06-19,MacKay et al. (1998),Yes,,,The stream in the last few years has redirected through a heavily forested cottonwood area with the main flow bypassing the right hand bank corner.    This is an area of heavy simplification of the river due to decking structure on the right bank. Upstream of hear the creek is channelized with defined dykes on both sides.  It appears there has been vegetation clearing along the riprap Dyke likely to reduce risk of failures due to Dropping trees.          
Bul38,2025-06-20,MacKay et al. (1998),Yes,,,Depth of incision of eroded bank is approximately 6m in height. Appears as though the large amount of slumping that took place was likely a result of vegetation clearing to accommodate the powerlines.          
bul32,2025-06-20,MacKay et al. (1998),Yes,,,Historic prescription site.  Erosion on left bank likely caused by high energy from riprap area of railway transferring to what appears to be a historic pasture area.  Provincial land ownership layer indicates that this land belongs to the municipality.  Across the highway just upstream is the location of a tributary stream that appears to have an annual blockage issues related to beaver.
Buc207,2025-06-22,MacKay et al. (1998),Yes,yes,,"It appears there has been recent erosion protection work here by MOTI and contractors with approximately 5m of riprap with geotextile and coconut matting above to the road edge.  Road surface is approximately 5 m above the water. There is sparse shrub regeneration,  particularly on the lower side of the area that has been revegetated above the rip wrap with some willow,  rose and cottonwood.          "
Buc172,2025-06-22,MacKay et al. (1998),Yes,,,"This is a late 90s prescription location however no physical works appear to have been conducted at this site. There is significant erosion on the left bank adjacent to Buck Flats Road with the edge of erosion within 2m of the power and telephone line. Seems likely that this site will require erosion protection or relocation of the road to protect the road and power infrastructure.

Likely a fairly heavy sediment source for the creek. The erosion extends upstream with the entire length of impacted area approximately 150 m long.          "
MX2,2025-06-24,HWI,Yes,yes,,"Site appears to be holding together quite well with sparse shrub cover but primarily agronomic grasses within footprint of the site. This is a peg boarding and wire site with stinger planted willow whips.  Overall shrub and occasional cottonwood cover is estimated at 7%.          

Overall, wondering if this was a site where the stream was jumping the channel and flooding the adjacent likely historic wetland location. From review of ortho imagery and assessment it appears as though this agricultural field is likely a drain wetland area with noticeable trenching along the outside road has been built. There is a die like structure adjacent to the outside of the site running much farther than where treatment was done, indicating this is acting as a levy to keep Maxine creek away from areas used for agriculture."
MX1,2024-06-24,Gaboury and Smith (2016); Smith and Gaboury (2016),Yes,yes,," The structures of the site seem to be holding up well it appears there are seven. Erosion just downstream of the third structure however, the fourth is still intact and a small enlarged weight reach out on a substream and which could result in the deposition of sediments and stabilization of the section in the long-term however, that is uncertain. Beaver activity obvious in this area with a breached down approximately 3/4 of the way Downstream. Overall riparian vegetation regrowth is poor estimated at one to 2% cover of planted willow whips and occasional naturals. It appears as though the planted stock could not compete with the economic grasses present here and may have experienced drought stress since replanting in 2021.           "
BR5,2025-06-24,Gaboury and Smith (2016); Smith and Gaboury (2016),Yes,yes,,"Works completed in 2016, 2021 and 2024. Site also visited with assessment in 2024. Overall, this site is in good shape and functioning well as erosion protection with 10 or more would debris structures than two rock groins. Riparian buffer strip is approximately 10 m to 15 m wide adjacent to agricultural field. Cuttings have been planted within ergonomic sod with what appears to be decent survival but poor target species vegetation cover dominance. It does not seem likely that shrub will become the dominant vegetation layer here without interventions such as manual, brushing, and the placement of some sort of mulch to reduce competition for light, water and nutrients."
