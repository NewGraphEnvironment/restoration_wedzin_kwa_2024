# Recommendations

Developing comprehensive restoration planning for the Neexdzii Kwah watershed is essential to ensure that the restoration activities address the underlying drivers of the degredation causeing the need for restoration in the first place. Understanding of the drivers of the degredation will require both intensive field assessments and the use of GIS that incorperates all data possible. The following recommendations are made to ensure that the restoration activities are effective and address the underlying drivers of the degredation:

-   Spatially delineate areas of high fisheries values based on known spawning and rearing habitat for fish species of interest. Where data gaps exist - develop study plans to understand where this high value habitat is and quantify its value for fish species of interest through standardized methodologies such as Fish and Fish Habitat Assessment Procedures [johnstonFishHabitatAssessment1996].
-   Develop a monitoring plan for the Neexdzii Kwah watershed restoration works that incorporates past monitoring methodology and also includes an updated monitoring schedule, monitoring objectives, and methods. Methodology using Watershed Restoration Procedures - Routine effectiveness evaluation procedures and riparian inventory techniques (LMH25 - percent cover by structural stage, species composition, etc.) could be utilized using pre-built digital forms served to field teams from the collaborative GIS project.
-   Acquire, georeference, archive and analyze historic imagery for the Neexdzii Kwah watershed and compare with recent LiDAR data to quantify historic changes in stream morphology resulting in loss of quantity and quality of water and fish habitat while highlighting areas of historic dredging, realignment, and floodplain disconnections due to infrastructure, to guide future restoration efforts.
-   Further refine parameters to select future restoration sites and develop a ranking system for each of the parameters to aid in the prioritization of future sites. Whenever possible, develop open-source workflows to extract ranking parameters from datasets unaltered from their original sources to facilitate the reproducibility of similiar analysis on other or updated datasets, both by ourselves and by others.
-   Develop criteria for minimal setbacks required for cattle exclusion and riparian restoration based on the ecosystem services provided by the riparian area and the potential for the area to provide habitat for fish species of interest. Utilize established standards when possible such as the [Riparian Areas Protection Regulation](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/plants-animals-ecosystems/fish/aquatic-habitat-management/riparian-areas-regulation) and the [Riparian Management Area Guidebook](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/forestry/managing-our-forest-resources/silviculture/silvicultural-systems/silviculture-guidebooks/riparian-management-area-guidebook) [@ministryofforests1995RiparianManagement].
