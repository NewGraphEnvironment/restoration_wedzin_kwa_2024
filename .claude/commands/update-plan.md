Update planning-with-files documents to reflect current progress.

## Steps

1. Read `task_plan.md` to understand current phase status
2. Read `progress.md` to see session history
3. Read `findings.md` to see documented discoveries

4. Ask user:
   - What tasks were completed since last update?
   - Any new findings or discoveries?
   - Any errors encountered?
   - Any new tasks to add?

5. Update `task_plan.md`:
   - Mark completed items with [x]
   - Update phase status (`pending` → `in_progress` → `complete`)
   - Add any new tasks identified
   - Log any errors in the Errors Encountered table

6. Update `findings.md`:
   - Add any new discoveries or research findings
   - Update status of reference materials reviewed
   - Add to Discoveries Log table

7. Update `progress.md`:
   - Add new session entry with date
   - List completed items
   - Note files modified
   - Document next steps

8. Summarize changes made to planning files
