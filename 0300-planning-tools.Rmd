# Planning Tools

## QRis


[QGIS Riverscapes Studio](https://qris.riverscapes.net/) (or QRis) is a free plugin for QGIS that helps you digitize your riverscape data. QRis is a great planning tool for helping users with spatial representation of riverscapes. 

QRis has two distinct types of features:
  
  * Static: These are features that are relatively permanent, such as the valley bottom.
  * Dynamic: These are features that change over time, such as the active channel.

QRis will be a useful tool for digitizing the upper Wetzin'kwa river and prirotizing restoration sites.
