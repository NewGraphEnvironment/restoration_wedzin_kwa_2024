Figure \@ref(fig:model-riparian-caption) is based on an evolving prescription template based on issues related to [riparian buffer size](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/restoration_framework/issues/2) and [riparian planting specifications](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/restoration_framework/issues/27).
