## Field Assessments

### Benthic Invertebrate Sampling

Benthic invertebrate sampling was conducted following the Canadian Aquatic Biomonitoring Network (CABIN) wadeable streams protocol [@environmentcanada2012Canadianaquatic]. Samples were collected using the traveling kick-net method with a 400 μm mesh net. At each site, a 3-minute timed sample was collected by traversing a zigzag pattern in an upstream direction within the erosional zone (riffle, rapid, or fast-flowing run habitat).

<br>

Concurrent with benthic sampling, standardized habitat and water quality data were collected. Substrate composition was characterized using a 100-pebble count, measuring the intermediate axis of randomly selected particles along transects. Embeddedness—the degree to which particles are buried in fine sediments—was assessed for every 10th particle. Channel slope was measured using a lazer level.

<br>

Water quality parameters recorded at each site included temperature, pH, and conductivity. Instream habitat features documented included macrophyte coverage (percent cover in categories: 0%, 1–25%, 26–50%, 51–75%, 76–100%), periphyton coverage (5-category scale based on slipperiness and thickness), and canopy cover. Channel dimensions including bankfull width, wetted width, and depths were also recorded.

<br>

Three sites were sampled on the Neexdzii Kwah mainstem within known high-value Chinook spawning and rearing habitat. Site locations were selected to assess aquatic health upstream and downstream of potential point-source impacts, allowing comparison of species composition and community health metrics across the watershed. Triplicate kick samples were collected at each site to quantify within-site variability and enable statistical distinction between true site differences and natural spatial heterogeneity.

<br>

Samples were preserved in 10% formalin and submitted to Cordillera Consulting Inc. (Summerland, BC) for sorting and taxonomic identification to genus/species level. Results will be uploaded to the federal CABIN database.


## Collaborative Data Management

### GIS Environment

A collaborative GIS environment (`restoration_wedzin_kwa`) was established using [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/) and [Mergin Maps](https://merginmaps.com/) to enable project team members to view, edit, and analyze shared spatial data on desktop computers and mobile devices in the field. The environment is used to develop and share maps, conduct spatial analyses, communicate restoration plans to stakeholders, and provide standardized digital forms for field assessments. The platform also tracks restoration activity progress and monitors landscape changes over time.

<br>

The QGIS project was created using scripts in [`dff-2022`](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/dff-2022) that:

  - download and clip layers from the [BC Data Catalogue](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/) and custom AWS buckets for the watershed area of interest
  - create a project directory with layer symbology, naming conventions, and metadata
  - store layer metadata in the `rfp_tracking` table within `background_layers.gpkg`, along with user-supplied stream width/gradient inputs to `bcfishpass` for modeling high-value fish habitat


### Data Sourcing

Whenever possible, data was sourced from existing government infrastructure in the Skeena region by downloading directly from the [Skeena Salmon Data Centre](https://data.skeenasalmon.info/) using the application programming interface to their [CKAN](https://ckan.org/features/api) database.


### Open Source Reporting Framework

This report is produced using open-source tools (R, bookdown) with full version control via git, enabling iterative updates as restoration planning progresses. All code, data, and revision history are publicly accessible in the [project repository](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/restoration_wedzin_kwa_2024), with ongoing tasks tracked via GitHub [issues](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/restoration_wedzin_kwa_2024/issues).


## Remote Sensing & Imagery

### Aerial Imagery

Scripted processing and serving of UAV imagery collected during the project is available at https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/stac_uav_bc/ [@irvine2025NewGraphEnvironmentstac_uav_bc]. [`OpenDroneMap`](https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/ODM) was utilized to produce orthomosaics, digital surface models (DSMs), and digital terrain models (DTMs) [@opendronemapauthors2025OpenDroneMapODM]. To support efficient web-based access - imagery products were converted to cloud-optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) using `rio-cogeo`, then collated accordiong to the [SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog  (STAC)](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec) specification with `pystac` and uploaded to S3 storage [@cogeotiff2025cogeotiffriocogeo; @radiantearth2024STACSpatioTemporal; @pystacauthors2025stacutilspystac, @amazonwebservices2025awsawscli]. A `titiler` tile server was set up to facilitate interactive viewing of the orthoimagery and an Application Program Interface (API) leveraging `stac-fastapi-pgstac` is served at https://images.a11s.one to enable linking of collection images through QGIS as well as remote spatial and temporal querying using open source software such as `rstac` [@developmentseed2025developmentseedtitiler; @stac-utils2025stacutilsstacfastapipgstac; @simoes_etal2021Rstacpackage].


### Time Series Analysis

Three approaches were developed for tracking land cover and stream morphology changes over time in floodplain and riparian areas.

<br>

**Satellite Imagery Composites:** A reproducible workflow was developed to generate annual orthomosaic composites from Sentinel-2 imagery (10m resolution) using STAC queries and `gdalcubes` [@appel_pebesma2019OnDemandProcessing; @simoes_etal2021Rstacpackage]. Cloud-free summer imagery (June–July, ≤20% cloud cover) is sourced from Microsoft's Planetary Computer for each year from 2016 to present, with median composites created to minimize atmospheric artifacts. The workflow is demonstrated at Maxam Creek near Bulkley Lake confluence, with detailed documentation at [new_graphiti](https://newgraphenvironment.github.io/new_graphiti/posts/2026-01-08-stac-ortho-mosaics/).

<br>

**Historic Aerial Imagery Comparison:** At select restoration sites, historic aerial imagery was accessed via Google Earth's time slider feature and exported to document land cover changes adjacent to areas where restoration activities have since occurred.

<br>

**Provincial Historic Orthophoto Discovery:** A workflow was developed to query the BC Data Catalogue and identify available historic aerial photographs with their spatial coverage relative to the study area. This enables targeted ordering of high-resolution historic imagery from the province for detailed change analysis. The workflow is documented at [new_graphiti](https://newgraphenvironment.github.io/new_graphiti/posts/2024-11-15-bcdata-ortho-historic/).


## Background Research & Analysis

### Historic Information

Historic information regarding impacts and restoration initiatives, prescriptions and activities is an important component of the restoration planning process. A wealth of information is present for the Neexdzii Kwah however it is located in many different locations and not always spatially represented.  To address this, a comprehensive review of past impact indentification and restoration recommendations is underway. This review included a review of the literature, interviews with local experts, and a review of the restoration prescriptions and activities that have been conducted in the Neexdzii Kwah. For information regarding relatively recent restoration efforts such as physical works conducted through Healthy Watersheds Initiative, representatives from the Morice Watershed Monitoring Trust amalgamated all information located on physical drives and either provided emails with the data attached or provided links to the data for the study team for download and review.  This information was then subsequently downloaded and re-uploaded to a `OneDrive` folder for the study team to access.


### Future Restoration Site Selection

#### Evaluation of Historic and Current Imagery
Evaluation of historic and current imagery to understand and quantify watershed characteristics and morphological changes in the Neexdzii Kwah and its major tributaries over time and guide future restoration efforts. This will require that the study team acquire, georeference, archive and analyze historic imagery for the Neexdzii Kwah watershed and compare with an analysis of recent data to quantify historic changes in stream morphology resulting in loss of quantity and quality of water and fish habitat.  Through this process we hope to highlight areas of historic dredging, realignment, and floodplain disconnections due to infrastructure that have degraded watershed health and fish habitat.

#### Fish Passage
At the time of writing, extensive work related to fish passage restoration planning was underway in the Neexdzii Kwah watershed
as well as other areas of the greater Skeena watershed.  Methodology for this work is presented in @irvine_schick2025SkeenaWatershed, @irvine_schick2024SkeenaWatershed, @irvine_wintersheidt2023SkeenaWatershed,
@irvine_etal2023BulkleyWatershed, @irvine2021BulkleyRiver and @irvine2018AnalysisPrioritya.  Although these references detail work primarily related to linear connectivity
(ie. upstream/downstream) there is also ongoing work related to lateral connectivity (ie. floodplain connectivity) with methodology related to disconnections due to the linear infrastructure documented in `bcfishpass` [@norris2024smnorrisbcfishpass] [here](https://github.com/smnorris/bcfishpass/tree/main/model/03_habitat_lateral).
The results of this analysis and future analysis incorporating major roadways as well (currently under development) will be added to the shared QGIS project and used to inform future restoration activity prioritization.

#### Local Knowledge for Site Selection
To facilitate project activities in the short term - the project team conducted site visits to areas of known riparian
removal and bank erosion where landowners are amenable to project activities including erosion protection, installation of cattle exclusion fencing and riparian planting.

#### Delineation of High Fisheries Value Areas
Past work to spatially delineate areas of high value habitat known to be utilized historically for chinook and sockeye salmon spawning (among other data) undertaken by DFO, Arocha Canada and others has been stored within a secure location and linked within the shared GIS project.  @wilson_rabnett2007FishPassage includes descriptions of traditional Wet'suwet'en Fisheries sites within the Neexdzii Kwah which will be spatialized for the project.

#### Parameter Ranking
Analysis of background and current data can be used to inform priority ranking criteria used to select sites for restoration activities in the long term. Although the process is ongoing - GIS and user input parameters were selected based on ongoing project team meetings and review of available spatial information to rank future restoration sites.   Using custom functions and scripted workflows based on layers kept within the shared GIS project - we prioritized proposed sites dynamically based on a range of metrics and user defined ranking.  Scripts to conduct the analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/restoration_wedzin_kwa_2024/blob/main/scripts/gis/prioritize.R) with custom functions [here](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/restoration_wedzin_kwa_2024/blob/main/scripts/functions.R).
