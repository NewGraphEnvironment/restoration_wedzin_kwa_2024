# Background

## Project Location

The study area primarily focuses on the Neexdzii Kwah (Upper Bulkley River), which is located upstream of the confluence of the Widzin Kwah (Morice River) and the Neexdzii Kwah rivers (Figure \@ref(fig:overview-map)).  Although this area is the initial focus of activities, the overall area for project activities can include anywhere within the boundaries of the Widzin Kwah Water Sustainability Project.  The boundaries of the Widzin Kwah Water Sustainability Project include not only the Neexdzii Kwah but also the entire drainage area of Widzin Kwah (Morice River) as well as the small portion of the Bulkley River downstream of the Morice River confluence to just north of Dockrill Creek [@WidzinKwahWaterSustainabilityProject].

The Neexdzii Kwah (Upper Bulkley River) is an 8th order stream that drains an area of 2320km^2^ in a generally northerly direction from Bulkley Lake on the Nechako Plateau to its confluence with the Widzin Kwah (Morice River) near Houston [@WidzinKwahWaterSustainabilityProject]. It has a mean annual discharge of `r round(fasstr::calc_longterm_mean(station_number = "08EE003")$LTMAD,1)` m^3^/s at station 08EE003 located near Houston. The hydrograph peaks around May - June during the spring freshet with additional peaks related to significant rain events (Figure \@ref(fig:hydrograph-fasstr1)). Highway 16 and the CN Railroad parallel the upper Bulkley River and pass through the towns of Topley and Houston.

Buck Creek is a 5th order stream which enters Neexdzii Kwah just upstream of the Wedzin Kwa / Neexdzii Kwah (Morice/Bulkley) confluence adjacent to Houston.  The watershed drains an area of 567km^2^. Buck Creek is one of the main tributaries to the Neexdzii Kwah and has a mean annual discharge of `r round(fasstr::calc_longterm_mean(station_number = "08EE013")$LTMAD,1)` m^3^/s at station 08EE013 located near the Houston Medical Centre approximately 1 km upstream of the mouth [@westcott2022UpperBulkley]. Flows from Buck Creek account for just under 1/3 of the total flows in Neexdzii Kwah. The hydrograph for Buck Creek shows a similar pattern to Neexdzii Kwah with peak flows in May - June (Figure \@ref(fig:hydrograph-fasstr2)).

There is one hydrometric station on McQuarrie Creek deployed by the BC Ministry of Forests, Land, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development Groundwater Program (FLNRORD) which was was active from 2016-2018 but has very few data [@westcott2022UpperBulkley]. An estimate of mean annual discharge for the two years of available data is `r round(fasstr::calc_longterm_mean(mq_clean),1)` m^3^/s at station 08EE0002 located near the mouth of the creek. Based of the limited data, the hydrograph for McQuarrie Creek during this time period peaks rapidly in May and again in the winter (Figures \@ref(fig:hydrograph3)).

### Widzin Kwah (Morice River)

# The Widzin Kwah (Morice River) watershed drains `r fwapgr::fwa_watershed_at_measure(360885316) %>% mutate(area_km2 = round(area_ha/100, 1)) %>% pull(area_km2)` km^2^ of Coast Mountains and Interior Plateau in a generally south-eastern direction. The Morice River is an 8th order stream that flows approximatley 80km from Widzin Bin (Morice Lake) to the confluence with the upper Bulkley River just north of Houston. Major tributaries include the Nanika River, the Atna River, Gosnell Creek and the Thautil River. There area numerous large lakes situated on the south side of the watershed including Morice Lake, McBride Lake, Stepp Lake, Nanika Lake, Kid Price Lake, Owen Lake and others. There is one active hydrometric station on the mainstem of the Morice River near the outlet of Morice Lake and one historic station that was located at the mouth of the river near Houston that gathered data in 1971 only [@canada2010NationalWater]. An estimate of mean annual discharge for the one year of data available for the Morice near it's confluence with the Bulkley River is `r round(fasstr::calc_longterm_mean(station_number = "08ED003")$LTMAD,1)` m^3^/s. Mean annual discharge is estimated at `r round(fasstr::calc_longterm_mean(station_number = "08ED002")$LTMAD,1)` m^3^/s at station 08ED002 located near the outlet of Morice Lake. Flow patterns are typical of high elevation watersheds influenced by coastal weather patterns which receive large amounts of winter precipitation as snow in the winter and large precipitation events in the fall. This leads to peak levels of discharge during snowmelt, typically from May to July with isolated high flows related to rain and rain on snow events common in the fall (Figures \@ref(fig:hydrograph4) - \@ref(fig:hydrology-stats4)).

### Climate Anomalies

To provide regional climate context, we used a custom fork of the [BC Climate Anomaly App](https://www.bcclimateanomaly.ca) to generate precipitation, mean temperature, and soil moisture anomaly plots for the study area [@bcgovernment2024BCclimate]. This version of the app - located [here](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/bc_climate_anomaly/tree/newgraph) allows for custom spatial inputs, enabling localized summaries served through the app locally.

<br>

Anomalies are calculated relative to 1981–2010 climate normals using ERA5-Land reanalysis data, regridded to ~30 km spatial resolution [@@munozsabater2019ERA5Landhourlya]. Trend direction and significance are assessed using the Mann-Kendall test and Theil-Sen slope estimator over the 1951–present period [@bcgovernment2024BCclimate].

<br>
See [Appendix 1 - Climate Anomaly Data](#app-climate-anomaly) for plots.


## Skeena Knowledge Trust
[The Skeena Knowledge Trust (SKT)](https://www.skeenatrust.ca/about/) serves as a centralized repository for data and information related to salmon and salmon habitat within the Skeena River watershed. To support informed decision-making, SKT provides access to a wide range of reports, datasets, and spatial information through its online platform. A summary of the available project packages and geospatial data can be found in Appendix 2, which provides an overview of key resources and their relevance to salmon conservation and habitat management in the region.

## Water Quality
Water quality in the Neexdzi Kwah watershed has been the focus of multiple key studies, including among others - @nijman1996Waterquality, @remington_donas2000Nutrientsalgae, @oliver2020Analysis2017 and @westcott2022UpperBulkleya. The background information and resulting recommendations contained within these reports are critical for informing watershed recovery actions, as water quality has the potential to be a limiting factor for fish and fish food. This detailed documentation can also be leveraged to serve as a baseline dataset in which to compare current and future conditions. The reader is encouraged to source information directly from the aforementioned reports as the following summary has been simplified greatly.

<br>

The technical report by @nijman1996Waterquality assessed the water quality of the Bulkley River headwaters, focusing on the impacts of the Equity mine, using available data on waste discharges, water quality, streamflows, and water use. It also identified water uses requiring protection and recommended provisional water quality objectives for the headwaters and downstream sections.

<br>

@remington_donas2000Nutrientsalgae put together the analysis of a significant amount of technical data related water, sediment and periphyton samples collected from November 1997 to March 2000 by the Habitat Restoration and Salmonid Enhancement Program (Fisheries and Oceans Canada) and others. Nutrients monitored included total phosphorus (TP), soluble orthophosphorus (SRP), ammonia, nitrate, organic nitrogen and total dissolved nitrogen. Periphytic algae was measured at nine sites September 1999 by Remington Enviromnental.  Substrate composition and interstitial dissolved oxygen measurement was also conducted at three sites in the upper Bulkley River mainstem as well as one site within Maxan Creek. Reporting from the project noted that the Neexdzi Kwah watershed has easily erodible glacial-fluvial and glacial-lacustrine soils and unusually high soluble phosphorus concentrations compared to other Skeena watershed streams, making it particularly vulnerable to eutrophication from nitrogen loading linked to septic, agriculture and livestock. They recommended a long-term, cost-effective ecosystem health monitoring strategy, incorporating water quality, periphyton, and benthic invertebrate bioassessment. Monitoring nutrients and algae was highlighted as a key approach to track changes over time, assess restoration success, and identify long-term trends within the upper Bulkley River mainstem and major tributaries to better target remedial actions.



## Fisheries

### Neexdzii Kwah

Traditionally, the salmon stocks passing through and spawning in the greater Bulkley River were the principal food source for the Gitxsan and Wet’suwet’en people living there [@wilson_rabnett2007FishPassage].  Anadromous lamprey passing through and spawning in the upper Neexdzii Kwah were traditionally also an important food source for the Wet'suwet'en (@gottesfeld_rabnett2007SkeenaFish; pers comm. Mike Ridsdale, Environmental Assessment Coordinator, Office of the Wet'suwet'en).  @gottesfeld_rabnett2007SkeenaFish report sourceing information from @departmentoffisheriesandoceans1991Fishhabitat that principal spawning areas for chinook in the Neexdzii Kwah include the mainstem above and below Buck and McQuarrie Creeks, between Cesford and Watson Creeks, and the reaches upstream and downstream of Bulkley Falls.

<br>

Renowned as a world class recreational steelhead and coho fishery, the greater Bulkley River downstream of Neexdzii Kwah receives some of the heaviest angling pressure in the province. In response to longstanding angler concerns with respect to overcrowding, quality of experience and conflict amongst anglers, an Angling Management Plan was drafted for the river following the initiation of the Skeena Quality Waters Strategy process in 2006 and an extensive multi-year consultation process. The plan introduces a number of regulatory measures with the intent to provide Canadian resident anglers with quality steelhead fishing opportunities. Regulatory measures introduced with the Angling Management Plan include prohibited angling for non-guided non-resident aliens on Saturdays and Sundays, Sept 1 - Oct 31 within the Bulkley River, angling prohibited for non-guided non-resident aliens on Saturdays and Sundays, all year within the Suskwa River and angling prohibited for non-guided non-resident aliens Sept 1 - Oct 31 in the Telkwa River. The Neexdzii Kwah is considered Class II water and there is no fshing permitted upstream of the Morice/Bulkley River Confluence [@flnro2013BulkleyRiver; @flnro2013OverviewAngling; @flnrord2019FreshwaterFishing].

<br>

#### Upper Bulkley Falls

A detailed field assessment and write up regarding the upper Bulkley falls was conducted as part of fish passage restoration in the watershed - is presented in @irvine2021BulkleyRiver with a condensed summary here. The site was assessed on October 28, 2021 by Nallas Nikal, B.i.T, and Chad Lewis, Environmental Technician. The top of the falls is located at 11U.678269.6038266 at an elevation of 697m approximatley 11.3km downstream of Bulkley Lake and upstream of Ailport Creek.  Within the Bulkley River immediately below the 12 - 15m high bedrock falls, channel width was 17.4m and the wetted width was 15.6m. Two channels comprised the falls. The primary channel was 20m long, had a channel/wetted width of 8.5m, a 16% grade and water depths ranging from 35 - 63cm.  The secondary channel was 25m long, with channel/wetted widths of 7.5m, a grade of 12% and water depths ranging from 3 - 13cm [@irvine2021BulkleyRiver].

<br>

@dyson1949BulkleyFalls and @stokes1956UpperBulkley report substantial use of habitat above Bulkley Falls by steelhead, chinook, coho and sockeye utilization in the past (pre-1950) based on spawning reports.  Both authors concluded that the Bulkley Falls pose a partial obstruction to migrating fish based on flow levels. Chinook, which migrate early in the summer when water levels are high, have been noted as able to ascend the falls in normal to high water years and in high water years it was thought that coho and steelhead could ascend.  @gottesfeld_rabnett2007SkeenaFish report that the falls are almost completely impassable to all salmon during low water flows.  @stokes1956UpperBulkley reports that there was high value spawning habitat located within the first 3km of the Neexdzii Kwah from the outlet of Bulkley Lake.

<br>

@wilson_rabnett2007FishPassage reported thataApproximately 11.3 km downstream of the Bulkley Lake outlet and just upstream of Watson Creek, the upper Bulkley falls is an approximately 4m high narrow rock sill that crosses the Neexdzii Kwah, producing a steep cascade section. This obstacle to fish passage is recorded as an almost complete barrier to fish passage for salmon during low water flows. @wilson_rabnett2007FishPassage also reported that coho have not been observed beyond the falls since 1972.

#### Fish Species

Fish species recorded in the greater Bulkley River watershed group are detailed in Table \@ref(tab:fiss-species-table) [@data_fish_obs]. Summaries of fish species life history, biology, stock status, and traditional use are documented in @schell2003BriefOverview, @wilson_rabnett2007FishPassage, @gottesfeld_etal2002ConservingSkeena and @officeofthewetsuweten2013Wetsuwet. @wilson_rabnett2007FishPassage discuss chinook, pink, sockeye, coho, steelhead and indigenous freshwater Bulkley River fish stocks within the context of key lower and upper Bulkley River habitats such as the Suskwa River, Station Creek, Harold Price Creek, Telkwa River and Buck Creek. Key areas within the upper Bulkley River watershed with high fishery values, documented in @schell2003BriefOverview, are the upper Bulkley mainstem, Buck Creek, Dungate Creek, Barren Creek, McQuarrie Creek, Byman Creek, Richfield Creek, Johnny David Creek, Aitken Creek and Emerson Creek. Some areas of high fisheries values for chinook, sockeye and coho are noted in @bustard_schell2002ConservingMorice as McBride Lake, Nanika Lake, and Morice Lake watersheds. 

```{r extra-morice}
# In the 1990's the Morice River watershed, @gottesfeld_rabnett2007SkeenaFish estimated that chinook comprised 30% of the total Skeena system chinook escapements. It is estimated that Morice River coho comprise approximatley 4% of the Skeena escapement with a declining trend noted since the 1950 in @gottesfeld_rabnett2007SkeenaFish Coho spawn in major tributaries and small streams ideally at locations where downstream dispersal can result in seeding of prime off channel habitats including warm productive sloughs and side channels. Of all the salmon species, coho rely on small tributaries the most [@bustard_schell2002ConservingMorice]. @bustard_schell2002ConservingMorice report that much of the distribution of coho into non-natal tributaries occurs during high flow periods of May - early July with road culverts blocking migration into these habitats.

## Restoration Philosophy

### Process-based Restoration

Process-based restoration is a relatively new approach to river restoration and is based on the understanding that river form and function is driven by the physical, chemical, and biological processes that take place within them [@beechie_etal2010ProcessbasedPrinciples]. Together, these processes shape rivers and flood planes, which is known as a riverscape [@shahverdian_etal2019ChapterBackground]. The goal of process-based restoration is to restore these processes to their the natural rates and magnitudes (essentially stage 0), which leads to the system restoring itself through biological processes and requires minimal corrective intervention [@ciotti_etal2021DesignCriteria, @polvi_wohl2013BioticDrivers]. This approach is in contrast to traditional river restoration, which focuses on restoring uniform and static form to the river, such as the channel shape, and is often done through hard engineering and has high costs [@beechie_etal2010ProcessbasedPrinciples]. Principles of process-based restoration adapted from @beechie_etal2010ProcessbasedPrinciples are included in Table \@ref(tab:tab-rest-princ-pb).

```{r tab-rest-princ-pb}
restoration_principles_pb %>% 
  fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = restoration_principles_pb_caption, scroll = FALSE)


```

<br>

Below is an example of process-based restoration using stage 0 methodology done at Deer Creek in Oregon, USA. In this project they filled in incised channels and added large wood to to the river to restore the natural floodplain elevation and re-establish multiple channels (Figure \@ref(fig:deer-creek-plan))[@meyer2018DeerCreek]. Although this project used relatively aggressive restoration techniques, they observed immediate improvements and the benefits were self-sustaining (Figure \@ref(fig:deer-creek-action))[@meyer2018DeerCreek].

```{r deer-creek-plan, fig.cap = 'An example of process-based restoration using stage 0 methodology to restored the natural floodplain elevation. In this project they filled in incised channels and added large wood to restore the natural floodplain elevation and re-establish multiple channels (Meyer, 2018).',eval=T}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/stage0_before_after.png")
```

<br>

```{r deer-creek-action, fig.cap = 'Before and after restoration took place at Deer Creek, USA. They observed imediate improvements to the habitat and the benefits were self-sustaining (Meyer, 2018).',eval=T}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/deer_creek_before_after.png")
```

Process-based restoration also includes many low-cost and low-tech restoration techniques. Resources are sourced from near-by areas, and the restoration is often done by hand, which makes it more accessible to a broad audience and can be done on a smaller scale [@shahverdian_etal2019ChapterBackground]. The primary goal of low-tech restoration is to improve the health of as many riverscapes possible by "letting the system do the work" [@shahverdian_etal2019ChapterBackground].

Low-cost process-based restoration could be an applicable in the Upper Bulkely riverscape. Some examples of low-cost restoration techniques include:

-   Grazing management
-   Riparian planting
-   Post-assisted log structures (PALS)
-   Beaver damn analogs (BDAs)

Further examples of low-cost process-based restoration are available [here](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2020/SGI/Modules/module1).


### Stage 0

The Stream Evolution Model (SEM) is used to understanding how the morphology of channels (such as rivers or streams) respond to disturbances like changes in base level, channelization, or alterations in flow and sediment regimes (Figure \@ref(fig:SEM-stages))[@cluer_thorne2014StreamEvolution]. An important features of the SEM is the inclusion of stage 0, which represents the state of the river before disturbances and is categorized as either an anastomosing wet woodland or an anastomosing grassed wetland (Figure \@ref(fig:SEM-stages))[@cluer_thorne2014StreamEvolution].

<br>

```{r SEM-stages, fig.cap = 'Cluer and Thorne’s (2014) stream evolution model which introduced stage 0, a stage that represents the state of the river before disturbances.',eval=T}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/SEM_stages.png")
```

<br>

The SEM also assigns a hydrogeomorphic attributes and habitat and ecosystem benefits score to each stage (Figure \@ref(fig:SEM-hab-benifits)). Stage 0 is the ultimate restoration goal, but the SEM suggests that there is a big difference in performance between disconnected and incised streams (stages 3-6) and connected streams (stages 7-1), and that stages 7-1 are the best targets for restoration because they have the highest ecosystem potential (Figure \@ref(fig:SEM-hab-benifits))[@cluer_thorne2014StreamEvolution].
<br>

```{r SEM-hab-benifits, fig.cap = 'Habitat and ecosystem benifits as well as hydrogeomorphic attributes associated with each stage of the SEM, suggesting that stages 7-1 have the highest ecosystem potential (Cluer and Thorne, 2014).',eval=T}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/SEM_hab_ben.png")
```

<br>

```{r all-benefits, fig.cap = 'Examples of how a stage 0 stream can benifit the entire riverscape and play an important role in the biophysical interactions between organisms (Hauer et al., 2016).',eval=T}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/benefits.png")
```
