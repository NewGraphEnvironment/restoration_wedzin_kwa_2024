  abstract = {Background Riparian corridors can affect nutrient, organic matter, and sediment transport, all of which shape water quality in streams and connected downstream waters. When functioning riparian corridors remain intact, they provide highly valued water quality ecosystem services. However, in rapidly urbanizing watersheds, riparian corridors are susceptible to development modifications that adversely affect those ecosystem services. Protecting high quality riparian corridors or restoring low quality corridors are widely advocated as watershed level water quality management options for protecting those ecosystem services. The two approaches, protection or restoration, should be viewed as complementary by watershed managers and provide a foundation for targeting highly functioning riparian corridors for protection or for identifying poorly functioning corridors for restoration. Ascertaining which strategy to use is often motivated by a specific ecosystem service, for example water quality, upon which watershed management is focused. We have previously reported on a spatially explicit model that focused on identifying riparian corridors that have specific characteristics that make them well suited for purposes of preservation and protection focused on water quality. Here we hypothesize that focusing on restoration, rather than protection, can be the basis for developing a watershed level strategy for improving water quality in urbanizing watersheds. Methods The model described here represents a geographic information system (GIS) based approach that utilizes riparian characteristics extracted from 40-meter wide corridors centered on streams and rivers. The model focuses on drinking water reservoir watersheds that can be analyzed at the sub-watershed level. Sub-watershed riparian data (vegetation, soil erodibility and surface slope) are scaled and weighted based on watershed management theories for water quality, and riparian restoration scores are assigned. Those scores are used to rank order riparian zones --the lower the score the higher the priority for riparian restoration. Results The model was applied to 90 sub-watersheds in the watershed of an important drinking water reservoir in north central Texas, USA. Results from this study area suggest that corridor scores were found to be most correlated to the amount of: forested vegetation, residential land use, soils in the highest erodibility class, and highest surface slope (r2~=~0.92, p~{$<~$}0.0001). Scores allow watershed managers to rapidly focus on riparian corridors most in need of restoration. A beneficial feature of the model is that it also allows investigation of multiple scenarios of restoration strategies (e.g.,~ revegetation, soil stabilization, flood plain leveling), giving watershed managers a tool to compare and contrast watershed level management plans.},

  abstract = {Hydrologic and physical gradients influence vegetation zonation and can form the basis of riparian revegetation design. We present a new data-driven method to develop riparian revegetation designs by relating the ground height above river (HAR) or a low streamflow water surface as a groundwater proxy to existing vegetation cover types and applying those relationships to design conditions. Steps in the process are as follows: (1) map existing vegetation within the riparian corridor; (2) construct existing and design topographic and groundwater digital elevation models (DEMs), and then difference those DEMs to create a HAR detrended DEM (HAR dtDEM); (3) define existing vegetation habitat zones using the relationship between existing HAR dtDEM and mapped vegetation cover types; (4) apply habitat zone boundaries to detrended design topography; and (5) develop planting schematics using habitat zones and detrended design topography. We developed a revegetation design for a rehabilitation site on the Trinity River, California, using the HAR dtDEM method. We used a data-driven method to define five habitat zones in riparian areas: aquatic, emergent margin, mesic, mesic--xeric transition, and xeric zones. Zonal boundaries were identified using four criteria: (1) capillary fringe elevation above the low flow water surface, (2) shifts from herbaceous to woody-dominated cover types, (3) a difference equal to or {$>$}0.5 m between two adjacent ranked cover types, and (4) locations where a linear trendline intersected median HAR values or where a group of regression residuals changed from positive to negative or vice versa. The capillary fringe height was the most effective method when determining vegetation zones near the channel. The shift between herbaceous and woody-dominated cover types defined the boundary between the emergent margin and mesic zone. Elevation increases {$>$}0.5 m between adjacent ranked cover types defined the upper and lower mesic--xeric transition zone boundaries best. Comparing linear residuals was most useful for separating drier cover types occurring on higher ground surfaces. Existing habitat zone boundaries were applied to detrended design topography to direct which selected native plant species could be arranged within habitat zones to improve planting survival and increase ecological function following rehabilitation.},

  abstract = {Climate models forecast significant changes in California's temperature and precipitation patterns. Those changes are likely to affect fluvial and riparian habitat. Across the American West several researchers and civil society groups promote increased beaver (Castor canadensis) presence as a means to moderate such changes. This study reviews three literatures in an effort to evaluate the potential for beaver to adapt to and to mitigate anticipated changes in California's higher elevation land- and waterscapes. First, I provide a synopsis of modeled changes in temperatures and precipitation. Forecasts agree that temperatures will continue to increase, to 1.5--4.0{$^\circ$} C by 2060; however, forecasts for precipitation are more variable in sign and among models. Second, researchers anticipate climate-driven changes in stream and riparian areas and project that snowpacks and summer flows will continue to decline, winter and spring flood magnitudes will increase, spring stream recession will likely continue to occur earlier and more quickly, and highland fires will be more extensive. Each of these changes has important implications for wildlife and public lands managers. A third focus reviews beaver natural histories and finds that where beaver dams are persistent, they may sequester sediment and create wet meadows that can moderate floods, augment early summer baseflows, sequester carbon in soils and standing biomass, decrease ecological problems posed by earlier spring stream recession, and potentially help cool early summer and post-wildfire stream temperatures. However, due in part to currently limited habitat suitability and to conflicts with other human interests, mitigation would likely be most meaningful on local rather than statewide scales.},

  abstract = {Water temperature appears to play a key role in determining population persistence of westslope cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi, but specific thermal performance and survival criteria have not been defined. We used the acclimated chronic exposure laboratory method to determine upper thermal tolerances and growth optima of westslope cutthroat trout and rainbow trout O. mykiss, a potential nonnative competitor that occupies much of the former range of westslope cutthroat trout. Rainbow trout had a distinct survival advantage over westslope cutthroat trout at water temperatures above 208C. The ultimate upper incipient lethal temperature of rainbow trout (24.38C; 95\% confidence interval [CI] {$\frac{1}{4}$} 24.0--24.78C) was 4.78C higher than that of westslope cutthroat trout (19.68C; 95\% CI {$\frac{1}{4}$} 19.1--19.98C). In contrast, both species had similar growth rates and optimum growth temperatures (westslope cutthroat trout: 13.68C; rainbow trout: 13.18C) over the temperature range of 8--208C, although rainbow trout grew over a wider range and at higher temperatures than did westslope cutthroat trout. The rainbow trout's higher upper temperature tolerance and greater growth capacity at warmer temperatures may account for the species' displacement of westslope cutthroat trout at lower elevations. Our results indicate that maximum daily temperatures near the optimum growth temperature of 13--158C would ensure suitable thermal habitat for westslope cutthroat trout populations. The low upper temperature tolerance and optimum growth temperature of westslope cutthroat trout relative to those of other salmonids suggest that this subspecies may be particularly susceptible to stream temperature increases associated with global warming and anthropogenic habitat disturbance.},

We used readily available geospatial data sets to calculate reach slopes, 2 year flood discharge, and valley confinement, as well as to develop hypothesized landscape-level surrogates for sediment load and caliber (relative slope, percent of drainage area in alpine terrain, and percent of drainage area in erosive fine-grained lithologies). Using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, we found that the four channel patterns were best distinguished by a model including all variables except valley confinement (82\% overall accuracy). We then used that model to predict channel pattern for the entire basin and found that the spatial distribution of straight, meandering, anabranching, and braided patterns were consistent with regional topography and geology. A simple slope-discharge model distinguished meandering channels from all other channel patterns, but did not clearly distinguish braided from straight channels (68\% overall accuracy). Addition of one or more of the hypothesized sediment supply surrogates improved prediction accuracy by 4--14\% over slope and discharge alone. Braided and straight channels were most clearly distinguished on an axis of relative slope, whereas braided and anabranching channels were most clearly distinguished by adding percent alpine area to the model.},

Ecosystem conditions at any site are governed by hierarchical regional, watershed, and reach-scale processes controlling hydrologic and sediment regimes; floodplain and aquatic habitat dynamics; and riparian and aquatic biota. We outline and illustrate four process-based principles that ensure river restoration will be guided toward sustainable actions: (1) restoration actions should address the root causes of degradation, (2) actions must be consistent with the physical and biological potential of the site, (3) actions should be at a scale commensurate with environmental problems, and (4) actions should have clearly articulated expected outcomes for ecosystem dynamics. Applying these principles will help avoid common pitfalls in river restoration, such as creating habitat types that are outside of a site's natural potential, attempting to build static habitats in dynamic environments, or constructing habitat features that are ultimately overwhelmed by unconsidered system drivers.},

  abstract = {Ecosystem management requires information on habitat suitability across broad scales; however, comprehensive environmental surveys in remote areas are often impractical and expensive to carry out. Intrinsic Potential (IP) models provide a means to identify on a broad scale those portions of the landscape that can provide essential habitat for various freshwater fish species. These models are derived from watershed patterns and processes that are persistent and not readily affected by human activities. We developed an IP model for rearing habitat of Chinook Salmon throughout the Copper River watershed (63,000 km2) in southcentral Alaska, utilizing digital elevation models, expert opinion, and field surveys. Our model uses three variables---mean annual flow, gradient, and glacial influence---and adequately predicts where probable habitat for juvenile Chinook Salmon occurs across this large landscape. This model can help resource managers map critical habitat for salmon throughout the Copper River watershed, direct field research to appropriate stream reaches, and assist managers in prioritizing restoration actions, such as culvert replacement. Intrinsic Potential modeling is broadly applicable to other salmonid species and geographies and may inform future work on the ecological impacts of climate change in polar and subpolar river systems.Received August 23, 2013; accepted December 20, 2013}

These areas are thought to be preferentially selected for a variety of reasons, including energy and/or predation refugia for spawners, and increased hyporheic exchange for incubating embryos. This research sought to quantify in-channel structure effects on local hydraulics and hyporheic flow and provide a mechanistic link between these changes and the survival, development, and growth of Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha embryos. Data were collected in an eight-kilometer reach, on the regulated lower Mokelumne River, in the California Central Valley. Nine paired sites, consisting of an area containing in-channel structure paired with an adjacent area lacking in-channel structure, were evaluated. Results indicated that in-channel structure disrupts surface water velocity patterns, creating pressure differences that significantly increase vertical hydraulic gradients within the subsurface. Overall, in-channel structure did not significantly increase survival, development, and growth of Chinook salmon embryos. However, at several low gradient downstream sites containing in-channel structure, embryo survival, development, and growth were significantly higher relative to paired sites lacking such features. Preliminary data indicate that adding or maintaining in-channel structure, including woody material, in suboptimal spawning reaches improves the incubation environment for salmonid embryos in regulated reaches of a lowland stream. More research examining temporal variation and a full range of incubation depths is needed to further assess these findings.},

  author = {Blackburn, Jason},
  year = {2017},
  abstract = {Westslope cutthroat trout (WSCT) is considered Threatened in Alberta under Canada's Species at Risk Act. Long-term survival of the species requires identification, protection and restoration of strongholds where genetically pure populations remain. One of the last remaining strongholds for the species is in the upper Oldman River watershed, which has undergone varying intensities of landscape disturbance. Fine sediment deposition from surrounding land-use activity has been identified as a key threat and major limiting factor affecting recovery of Alberta's WSCT populations. We completed a comprehensive, two-year study to document abundance, population structure and distribution of genetically pure WSCT relative to trends in sedimentation. We surveyed more than 25 km of stream at 73 randomly selected sampling sites along the mainstems of 18 streams, collecting fish, sediment, habitat, stream channel and pool information. We collected fish size, abundance and distribution information using backpack and totebarge electrofishing methods; measured sediment quantity and composition; and performed pool counts to determine pool frequency. We constructed generalized additive models of sediment quantity, and longitudinal WSCT abundance by maturity class, using single-pass electrofishing data corrected with capture-mark-recapture derived capture-efficiencies. In all, we captured 3,824 WSCT and collected 1,151 tissue samples for genetic (DNA) analysis. We recorded the highest catch rates of WSCT (all fish {$\geq$}70 mm fork length; FL) in Vicary Creek (355 fish/km), juveniles ({$\geq$}70 -- 149 mm FL) in Pasque Creek (321 fish/km) and adults ({$\geq$}150 mm) in Ridge Creek (247 fish/km). Rearing streams, where catches were dominated by juvenile fish and where fish sizes were the smallest, were Pasque (91\% juveniles, 83 mm FL), Oyster (91\% juveniles, 93 mm FL), Speers (84\% juveniles, 110 mm FL), and Beaver (79\% juveniles, 115 mm FL) creeks. Streams where catches were dominated by adult fish and median fish size was the largest were Deep (75\% adults, 189 mm FL), Ridge (71\% adults, 172 mm FL) and Lyall (71\% adults, 160 mm FL) creeks. Of the watersheds suitable for modelling longitudinal abundance of WSCT, the highest mainstem abundance was in Vicary Creek for both total fish (n = 20,930) and juveniles (n = 14,344), exceeding that of Racehorse, South Racehorse, North Racehorse, Dutch and Hidden creeks combined. The highest adult abundance occurred in White Creek (n = 9,012), exceeding that of Racehorse, South Racehorse, North Racehorse and Dutch creeks combined. Streams among those with both the highest proportion of fine sediment fractions {$<$}6 and {$<$}2 mm and median sediment volumes included Pasque, Speers, Oyster, Deep and Ridge creeks. Streams among those with the lowest fine sediment proportions and volumes included Daisy, Mean, Racehorse, North Racehorse, Dutch, Beehive and Hidden creeks. Scour-pool frequency was variable relative to sediment quantity; however, it was highest in many of the streams where median sediment volume was also highest. The highest scour-pool frequencies occurred in White Creek (36 pools/km), followed by Ridge and Oyster creeks (33 pools/km) and Pasque Creek (22 pools/km), which were also some of the streams with the highest WSCT catch rates. The relationship between sediment quantity and fish population structure within the watersheds in the study area was unclear. Pasque, Speers and Oyster creeks had both the highest proportions of fine sediment as well as juvenile fish. Conversely, Ridge and Deep creeks had the highest proportion of adult-sized fish but were still among the streams with the highest sediment levels. Through concurrent modelling of longitudinal sediment quantity, and WSCT abundance, we revealed that watersheds with the highest catch rates had a trend of decreasing deposited sediment quantity in a downstream direction, whereas those with the lowest catch rates had a trend of increasing deposited sediment quantity in a downstream direction. Variables such as reach-scale channel morphology, stream gradient and elevation may have confounded interpretation of relationships between sediment quantity and fish abundance by differentially altering sediment transport, retention and/or settling rates. For example, deep bedrock pools and high-gradient step-pool sequences retained fish but did not create scour-pools from which to measure transported sediment. Pool availability may also have confounded interpretation of maturity-class composition relative to sediment. Both Vicary and White creeks had similar measures of fine deposited sediment; however, White Creek, which had the most scour-pools per kilometre, had an inverse longitudinal relationship between adult and juvenile abundances, whereas Vicary Creek, which had fewer scour-pools, had a disproportionate abundance of juveniles. Proximity of disturbances to the stream channel may be a key variable influencing WSCT longitudinal population structure, given adult abundance in South Racehorse Creek plummeted sharply where the stream closely parallels a main road and access is increased.The interactions between fine deposited sediment, stream morphology, WSCT abundance and population structure were complex and will require considerable further analysis to better understand underlying mechanisms that impact WSCT populations in the upper Oldman River watershed.}

With an open-channel flume, we observed volitional swim performance of wild-caught Rainbow Trout and Westslope Cutthroat Trout; the fish were not coerced, prodded, or spooked into action. We also observed the maximum short-duration swim speed of the fish, providing important effective leap or velocity challenge information for the design of intentional barriers. We conducted the experiment with a consistently low water velocity challenge and characterized swim speeds by using weighted least-squares regression, revealing no evidence of a difference in swim speeds between the two species. We estimated the overall average swim speed for Rainbow Trout to be 0.84 m/s (SE {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.02), with a 95\% confidence interval of 0.79--0.89 m/s, and that for Westslope Cutthroat Trout to be 0.84 m/s (SE {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.03), with a 95\% confidence interval of 0.78--0.90 m/s.

We hypothesised that hydrological mechanisms in such watersheds tend to spatially segregate spawning and over-summering habitats, and tested the hypothesis using observations from a series of tributaries in a pristine watershed. Consistent with the hypothesis, reaches with suitably sized spawning gravels tended to occur in intermittent tributaries, and also the perennial mainstem (which was too warm for over-summering). In early summer, juvenile O. mykiss ({$<$}10 cm) occurred at similar densities in the intermittent and perennial tributaries, but larger fish had greater densities in perennial tributaries. Large wood debris would be expected to mitigate the spatial segregation of habitats somewhat, but was scarce, though stream-side outcrops appeared to partially compensate by forcing gravel bars in high-gradient channels.},

We conducted a watershed-scale experiment to test how increasing beaver dam and colony persistence in a highly degraded incised stream affects the freshwater production of steelhead (               Oncorhynchus mykiss               ). Following the installation of beaver dam analogs (BDAs), we observed significant increases in the density, survival and production of juvenile steelhead without impacting upstream and downstream migrations. The steelhead response occurred as the quantity and complexity of their habitat increased. This study is the first large-scale experiment to quantify the benefits of beavers and BDAs to a fish population and its habitat. Beaver mediated restoration may be a viable and efficient strategy to recover ecosystem function of previously incised streams and to increase the production of imperiled fish populations.},

Fourteen of 31 sites lacked evidence of O. mykiss introgression, and gene flow among these nonhybridized O. c. lewisi populations was low, as indicated by significant allele frequency divergence among populations ({\texttheta}ST = 0.076, {$\rho$}ST = 0.094, P {$<$} 0.001). Among hybridized sites, O. mykiss admixture declined with upstream distance from a site containing a hybrid swarm with a predominant (92\%) O. mykiss genetic contribution. The spatial distribution of hybrid genotypes at seven diagnostic microsatellite loci revealed that O. mykiss invasion is facilitated by both long distance dispersal from this hybrid swarm and stepping-stone dispersal between hybridized populations. This study provides an example of how increased straying rates in the invasive taxon can contribute to the spread of extinction by hybridization and suggests that eradicating sources of introgression may be a useful conservation strategy for protecting species threatened with genomic extinction.},

To bring together understanding of the role that beavers may play in the management of water resources, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems, this article reviews the state-of-the-art scientific understanding of the beaver as the quintessential ecosystem engineer. This review has a European focus but examines key research considering both Castor fiber---the Eurasian beaver and Castor canadensis---its North American counterpart. In recent decades species reintroductions across Europe, concurrent with natural expansion of refugia populations has led to the return of C. fiber to much of its European range with recent reviews estimating that the C. fiber population in Europe numbers over 1.5 million individuals. As such, there is an increasing need for understanding of the impacts of beaver in intensively populated and managed, contemporary European landscapes. This review summarizes how beaver impact: (a) ecosystem structure and geomorphology, (b) hydrology and water resources, (c) water quality, (d) freshwater ecology, and (e) humans and society. It concludes by examining future considerations that may need to be resolved as beavers further expand in the northern hemisphere with an emphasis upon the ecosystem services that they can provide and the associated management that will be necessary to maximize the benefits and minimize conflicts., This article is categorized under:Water and Life {$>$} Nature of Freshwater Ecosystems , This article reviews the state-of-the-art scientific understanding of the beaver as an ecosystem engineer.

  abstract = {Dam removal has been increasingly proposed as a river restoration technique, with several projects scheduled to occur in the western United States. In 2011, two large hydroelectric dams will be removed from the Elwha River on Washington State's Olympic Peninsula in one of the nation's largest dam removal projects. Ten anadromous fish populations are expected to recolonize {\textasciitilde}130 km of historical habitats after dam removal. A key to understanding watershed recolonization and ecosystem restoration is the collection of spatially continuous information on fish and aquatic habitats. To date, no studies have described spatially continuous fish and habitat relationships prior to dam removal, and consecutive-year studies throughout an entire river are rare. We conducted concurrent snorkel and habitat surveys in the Elwha River from the headwaters to the mouth (rkm 65 to 0) in 2007 and 2008. This ``riverscape'' approach was used to characterize spatial extent, assemblage structure, abundances, densities, and length classes of Pacific salmonids along a nearly continuous longitudinal gradient of 316 channel units. The longitudinal fish assemblage patterns revealed that species richness was highest below the dams, where anadromous salmonids still have access. The percent composition of salmonids was nearly identical in 2007 and 2008 for rainbow and cutthroat trout (89\%; 88\%), Chinook salmon (8\%; 9\%), and bull trout (3\% in both years). Pink salmon were observed ({$<$}1\%) in 2007 only. Spatial patterns of abundance for rainbow and cutthroat trout (Pearson's correlation, r = 0.76) and bull trout (r = 0.70) were consistent between years despite differences in river flows in 2007 and 2008. Both multivariate and univariate analyses revealed clear differences in habitat structure along the river profile, due to both natural and anthropogenic factors. The generated fish and habitat profiles helped to visualize fish and habitat relationships and revealed unexpected spatial variations in fish abundances. This comprehensive view helped to highlight species-specific biological hotspots, revealing that 60-69\% of federally threatened bull trout occurred near or below the dams. The riverscape approach also helped to focus future monitoring efforts, and addressed linkages between fish and aquatic habitats prior to dam removal. Spatially continuous surveys will be vital in evaluating the effectiveness of upcoming dam removal projects at restoring anadromous salmonids. These surveys are part of a larger effort to complete an atlas of riverscapes in major Olympic Peninsula rivers.},

  abstract = {Groundwater discharge to rivers takes many forms, including preferential groundwater discharge points (PDPs) along riverbanks that are exposed at low flows, with multi-scale impacts on aquatic habitat and water quality. The physical controls on the spatial distribution of PDPs along riverbanks are not well-defined, rendering their prediction and representation in models challenging. To investigate the local riverbank sediment controls on PDP occurrence, we tested drone-based and handheld thermal infrared to efficiently map PDP locations along two mainstem rivers. Early in the study, we found drone imaging was better suited to locating tributary and stormwater inflows, which created relatively large water surface thermal anomalies in winter, compared to PDPs that often occurred at the sub-meter scale and beneath riparian tree canopy. Therefore, we primarily used handheld thermal infrared imaging from watercraft to map PDPs and larger seepage faces along 12-km of the fifth-order Housatonic River in Massachusetts, USA and 26-km of the Farmington River in Connecticut, USA. Overall, we mapped 31 riverbank PDPs along the Housatonic reach that meanders through lower permeability soils, and 104 PDPs along the Farmington reach that cuts through sandier sediments. Riverbank soil parameters extracted at PDP locations from the Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database did not differ substantially from average bank soils along either reach, although the Farmington riverbank soils were on average 5{\texttimes} more permeable than Housatonic riverbank soils, likely contributing to the higher observed prevalence of PDPs. Dissolved oxygen measured in discharge water at these same PDPs varied widely, but showed no relation to measured sand, clay, or organic matter content in surficial soils indicating a lack of substantial near-surface aerobic reaction. The PDP locations were investigated for the presence of secondary bank structures, and commonly co-occurred with riparian tree root masses indicating the importance of localized physical controls on the spatial distribution of riverbank PDPs.},

This evolutionarily significant unit is a threatened species, and both fish abundance and distribution are reduced from historical levels. The IP model focuses on geomorphic conditions that lead to the development of a habitat that fish use and includes three geomorphic channel parameters: confinement, width and gradient. We found that the amount of potential habitat for each population does not correlate with current, depressed, total population abundance. However, reaches currently used by spawners have high IP, and IP model results correlate well with results from the complex Ecosystem Diagnosis and Treatment model. A disproportionately large amount of habitat with the best potential is currently inaccessible to fish because of anthropogenic barriers. Sensitivity analyses indicate that uncertainty in the relationship between channel width and habitat suitability has the largest influence on model results and that model form influences model results more for some populations than for others.

The Gardiner Dam, one of the structures that forms the Lake Diefenbaker reservoir located in the Canadian Prairies, is managed for hydropower generation and agricultural irrigation and is known to have widely altering temperature regimes and nutrient circulations. This study applies the hydrodynamic and nutrient CE-QUAL-W2 model to explore how various withdrawal depths (5, 15, 25, 35, 45, and 55\,m) influence the concentrations and distribution of nutrients, temperature, and dissolved oxygen (DO) within the Lake Diefenbaker reservoir. As expected, the highest dissolved nutrient (phosphate, PO43--P and nitrate, NO3--N) concentrations were associated with hypoxic depth horizons in both studied years. During summer high flow period spillway operations impact the distribution of nutrients, water temperatures, and DO as increased epilimnion flow velocities route the incoming water through the surface of the reservoir and reduce mixing and surface warming. This reduces reservoir concentrations but can lead to increased outflow nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations. Lower withdrawal elevations pull warmer surface water deeper within the reservoir and decrease reservoir DO during summer stratification. During fall turnover low outflow elevations increase water column mixing and draws warmer water deeper, leading to slightly higher temperatures and nutrient concentrations than shallow withdrawal elevations. The 15\,m depth (540\,m above sea level) outflow generally provided the best compromise for overall reservoir and outflow nutrient reduction.},

  abstract = {The foundations of river restoration science rest comfortably in the fields of geology, hydrology, and engineering, and yet, the impetus for many, if not most, stream restoration projects is biological recovery. Although Lane's stream balance equation from the mid-1950s captured the dynamic equilibrium between the amount of stream flow, the slope of the channel, and the amount and calibre of sediment, it completely ignored biology. Similarly, most of the stream classification systems used in river restoration design today do not explicitly include biology as a primary driver of stream form and process. To address this omission, we cast biology as an equal partner with geology and hydrology, forming a triumvirate that governs stream morphology and evolution. To represent this, we have created the stream evolution triangle, a conceptual model that explicitly accounts for the influences of geology, hydrology, and biology. Recognition of biology as a driver leads to improved understanding of reach-scale morphology and the dynamic response mechanisms responsible for stream evolution and adjustment following natural or anthropogenic disturbance, including stream restoration. Our aim in creating the stream evolution triangle is not to exclude or supersede existing stream classifications and evolutionary models but to provide a broader ``thinking space'' within which they can be framed and reconsidered, thus facilitating thought outside of the alluvial box.},

Here, we use genetic stock identification and otolith analyses to quantify estuarine habitat use by Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) --- the Pacific salmon species considered most reliant on this habitat --- in Canada's most productive salmon river, the Fraser River. Two years of sampling revealed subyearling migrant (ocean-type) Chinook from the Harrison River to be the estuary's dominant salmon population throughout the emigration period. These Chinook salmon were caught predominantly in the estuary's brackish marshes but shifted to more saline habitats as they grew. Otolith analyses indicated that these Chinook salmon have wide-ranging entry timing (from February to May) and longer estuarine residency (weeks to months, mean 41.8 days) than estimated by prior studies, but similar daily growth rates (mean 6 SD: 0.57 6 0.13 mm) across entry dates and residency periods, implying sufficient foraging opportunities throughout the emigration period and habitats. Together, these results suggest that estuarine habitat is more important for early marine growth of subyearling migrant Chinook salmon than previously recognized.},

  abstract = {Interfacing with land and sea, estuaries support a mosaic of habitats that underpin the production of many coastal fisheries. These ecosystems are threatened by multiple stressors, including habitat loss and climate change, but the relative importance of estuarine habitat types for different fish species remains poorly understood since direct habitat comparisons are rare. This knowledge gap is exemplified in temperate estuaries by salmon --- ecologically and commercially important species that use estuaries during their migrations to and from the ocean. Here, we tested for species-specific habitat use by sampling fishes in 3 interconnected estuarine habitats (brackish marsh, eelgrass, and sand flat), across seasons and temperature regimes. We quantified fish species richness, community distinctness, and catches (of Chinook and chum salmon, other migratory fishes, and resident fishes) in the Pacific Northwest's heavily urbanized Fraser River estuary, the terminus of what was once the world's most productive salmon basin. Overall, eelgrass habitat supported the greatest fish species richness (n = 37) and catches (37 402 fish), exceeding that of both the marsh (19 species, 7154 fish) and sand flat (22 species, 6697 fish). However, the majority of salmon were caught in the marsh (61\%). These differences, coupled with our finding that at least one unique fish species inhabited each habitat (eelgrass = 15, marsh = 8, sand flat = 1), demonstrate species-specific habitat use and underscore the importance of connected seascapes for biodiversity conservation.},

  abstract = {Degree-days (DD) are an increasingly popular method for explaining variation in fish growth and development. By including a base temperature (To) the DD formula limits calculations to temperatures that are relevant to growth. However, our review of growth studies shows multiple To values in use for a given fish species. To determine how To affects the ability of DD to explain within-population growth variation, we first show that the ability of DD to describe a growing season is robust to low values of To. We then analyze immature length data from eight species and 85 water bodies in North America to show that there is a broad range of To values that effectively explain growth variation. Based on these results, we argue that precise To estimates are unwarranted for most single-population studies and recommend standard To values (0, 5, 10, 15 {$^\circ$}C). Standardization facilitates comparative studies and promotes the use of DD in future research. To this end, we provide equations for converting annual DD at a given To to annual DD at a standard To.},

  abstract = {Native salmonids are increasingly restricted to upstream habitats that may be too cold to sustain recruitment, and recruitment limitation owing to cold temperatures is a main hypothesis to explain translocation failures of native cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii in high-elevation streams in the southern Rocky Mountains. We subjected Colorado River cutthroat trout O. c. pleuriticus fry to one of three temperature regimes (cold, intermediate, or warm), which averaged 7.0, 8.5, and 10.08C during the warmest summer month, in each of 2 years. The regimes mimicked those of natural streams where translocated fish had died out or produced populations of cutthroat trout of low or high abundance. The mean fry survival rate from hatching through swim-up was high during both experiments, ranging from 97\% in the warm regime to 85\% in the cold. After swim-up, fry in the warm regime grew more than 60\% more on average than those in the cold regime by the onset of winter in 2003 during a 22-week period. Survival rates through midwinter were also higher in the warm regime (76\%) than in the intermediate (62\%) and cold (29\%) regimes. A similar pattern of temperature-related growth and mortality was apparent in the 2004 experiment (12 weeks), in which survival rates to early winter ranged from 44\% in the warm regime to 10\% in the cold. Most mortality in all three treatments occurred during a recruitment bottleneck encompassing a 4--6-week period following swimup. Analyses of size and percent dry weight indicated that the energy content of fry after swim-up was lower in colder regimes and declined during the recruitment bottleneck in all three regimes. Our findings indicate a strong recruitment bottleneck after swim-up when temperature-related energy deficits apparently cause significant mortality. Managers may increase the viability of these translocated populations by selecting sites that accumulate more than 900 degree-days during summer.},

  abstract = {Translocation is a key strategy for conserving native subspecies of cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii that have declined markedly throughout their native range. Previous research showed that successful translocations of cutthroat trout in high-elevation southern Rocky Mountain streams were more likely in streams with warm summer water temperature and led to the hypothesis that cold summer temperatures govern translocation success by limiting recruitment. We tested this by measuring the density and size of age-0 cutthroat trout (greenback cutthroat trout O. c. stomias and Colorado River cutthroat trout O. c. pleuriticus) in six headwater streams in north-central Colorado that varied in thermal characteristics. Surveys were conducted at peak emergence during 3 years in two widely spaced study reaches in each stream. Fry density increased with Celsius degree-days accumulated during the growing season but did not vary significantly among years. We used laboratory data on the growth and survivorship of age-0 cutthroat trout in three temperature regimes that were similar to those studied in the field to determine expected survivorship and size of fry at the start of winter, which occurred several weeks after peak emergence in our warmer reaches and coincided with emergence in colder reaches. Our results support the hypothesis that recruitment of native cutthroat trout in Colorado is limited by cold water temperatures that reduce growth and recruitment. High-elevation streams, like those studied, that accumulate 900--1,200 Celsius degree-days during the growing season afford the best opportunity for cutthroat trout recruitment and translocation success. Streams that provide 800--900 degree-days probably sustain recruitment in some years, and those with less than 800 degree-days are generally unsuitable for translocations because of a greater risk of recruitment failure and the smaller sizes attained by fry by the onset of winter.},

We collected two years of data on Arctic grayling movement through a series of beaver dams in a low gradient mountain stream, utilizing radio-telemetry techniques, to determine how hydrology, dam characteristics, and fish attributes impeded passage and movement rates of spawning grayling. We compared fish movement between a ``normal'' flow year and a ``low'' flow year, determined grayling passage probabilities over dams in relation to a suite of factors, and predicted daily movement rates in relation to the number of dams each fish passed and distance between dams during upstream migration to spawning areas. We found that the average passage probability over unbreached beaver dams was 88\%, though we found that it fell below 50\% at specific dams. Upstream passage of grayling was affected by three main characteristics: (a) temperature, (b) breach status, and (c) hydrologic linkages that connect sections of stream above and below the dam. Other variables influence passage, but to a lesser degree. Cumulative passage varied with distance upstream and total number of dams passed in low versus normal flow years, while movement rates upstream slowed as fish swam closer to dams. Our findings demonstrate that upstream passage of fish over beaver dams is strongly correlated with hydrologic conditions with moderate controls by dam- and fish-level characteristics. Our results provide a framework that can be applied to reduce barrier effects when and where beaver dams pose a significant threat to the upstream migration of fish populations while maintaining the diverse ecological benefits of beaver activity when dams are not a threat to fish passage.},

  abstract = {The reported decline of native bull trout Salvelinus confluentus and westslope cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi populations west of the Continental Divide in Glacier National Park (GNP) prompted research to identify critical habitats and investigate factors influencing their distribution and relative abundance. We evaluated the association of six abiotic factors (stream width, elevation, gradient, large woody debris density, pool density, mean August stream temperature) and a biotic factor (the presence of nonnative lake trout, Salvelinus namaycush) with the occurrence and density of bull trout and westslope cutthroat trout in 79 stream reaches in five sub-drainages of the North Fork Flathead River in GNP. Logistic and linear regression models were used to quantify the influence of these independent variables on species occurrence (presence/absence) and density ({$>$}age-1 fish/100m2), and an information theoretic approach (AICc) was used to determine the most plausible combinations of variables in each case. The occurrence of westslope cutthroat trout was negatively associated with the presence of lake trout and positively associated with large woody debris and water temperature. Westslope cutthroat were detected throughout a wide range of mean summer (August) water temperatures (8.5 -- 16oC), stream widths and elevations, but were most abundant in narrow, complex reaches that were not connected to lakes supporting lake trout. Bull trout occurrence was positively related to stream width and negatively related to channel gradient and water temperature. Bull trout were most abundant in narrow ({$<$} 10 m) stream reaches with relatively cold August water temperatures (8 -- 10oC) and in stream reaches not affected by lake trout. The low densities and limited distribution of bull trout likely reflect their imperiled status in GNP, owing to the invasion and establishment of nonnative lake trout from Flathead Lake. These data may be used to monitor critical habitats and populations, inform conservation and recovery programs, and guide suppression efforts to reduce the deleterious impacts of nonnative invasive fishes.}

  abstract = {Yukon River Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha are described as having a ``stream-type'' life history strategy. After emergence from river gravel, juveniles typically feed and grow in tributary streams of the Yukon River throughout their first summer, overwinter in freshwater, and usually leave their rearing areas for marine waters during the second spring or summer. Nonnatal rearing has been described in the upper Canadian portion of the drainage, but information is lacking for downstream U.S. waters. In 2006--2007, a study was conducted to document nonnatal rearing and the genetic origin of Chinook salmon in U.S. tributary streams of the Yukon River. Eight nonspawning streams were selected for study, seven located in a 260-km segment between the U.S.--Canada border and Circle, Alaska, and one located 742 km downstream from the border. Age-0 juveniles were captured in all eight streams. Genetic stock composition analyses using 13 standardized microsatellite loci assigned the fish to Canadian source populations. The Carmacks region (over 460 km upstream from the border) contributed 91\% to the mixtures in 2006 and 82\% in 2007. Canadian stocks nearest the border and from large river systems were underrepresented in the collections. Simulation and known-origin mixture analyses demonstrated that stock composition and individual assignment estimates derived from the genetic baseline were accurate and precise. Some juveniles may have traveled over 1,200 km to reach rearing areas in U.S. waters. Future studies would help define the importance of this life history strategy to the overall health and productivity of Yukon River Chinook salmon.},

  abstract = {Objective Large rivers are complex, productive environments that support numerous species. However, humans have extensively modified these ecosystems, contributing to the decline of Pacific salmonid Oncorhynchus spp. populations. Salmon recovery efforts rely upon an understanding of salmonid habitat needs at different life stages, but data on juvenile salmonid habitat use within large rivers are rare due to the challenges of sampling in large rivers. To help fill this information need, we used a cataraft-mounted electrofisher to evaluate juvenile salmonid use of natural (bar, backwater, side channel, and unarmored bank) and human-modified (riprap-armored bank and biorevetment bank [armored banks with added wood]) channel edge habitats in the Snoqualmie and Green rivers within the Puget Sound region of Washington State. Methods We electrofished over 1000 25-m transects across seven spring rearing seasons (2016--2022) and measured transect water depths and widths of low-velocity habitat ({$\leq$}0.45 m/s). Result Bars, backwaters, and side channels were shallower and had wider low-velocity habitat than armored banks. River flow also influenced water depth and low-velocity width, but the relationship varied depending on the habitat type. Subyearling Chinook Salmon O. tshawytscha and subyearling Coho Salmon O. kisutch occurred more frequently and were more abundant along natural edge habitats than along armored banks, while their use of biorevetment banks was intermediate between their use of natural edge habitats and armored banks. In contrast, yearling Coho Salmon and trout occurred more frequently and were more abundant along armored, biorevetment, and unarmored banks than along bars and backwaters, but they also used side channels extensively. Habitat use shifted throughout the spring, but specific shifts varied by species or life history stage. Conclusion These results emphasize the importance of conserving natural edge habitats, removing bank armoring, and reconnecting or restoring side channels. Additionally, our results highlight that a diversity of habitat types and conditions is necessary to support multiple species and life history stages.},

  abstract = {Hydrologic extremes dominate chemical exports from riparian zones and dictate water quality in major river systems. Yet, changes in land use and ecosystem services alongside growing climate variability are altering hydrologic extremes and their coupled impacts on riverine water quality. In the western U.S., warming temperatures and intensified aridification are increasingly paired with the expanding range of the American beaver---and their dams, which transform hydrologic and biogeochemical cycles in riparian systems. Here, we show that beaver dams overshadow climatic hydrologic extremes in their effects on water residence time and oxygen and nitrogen fluxes in the riparian subsurface. In a mountainous watershed in Colorado, U.S.A., we find that the increase in riparian hydraulic gradients imposed by a beaver dam is 10.7--13.3 times greater than seasonal hydrologic extremes. The massive hydraulic gradient increases hyporheic nitrate removal by 44.2\% relative to seasonal extremes alone. A drier, hotter climate in the western U.S. will further expand the range of beavers and magnify their impacts on watershed hydrology and biogeochemistry, illustrating that ecosystem feedbacks to climate change will alter water quality in river systems., Beaver dams increase water flow gradients and nitrate removal far more than seasonal climate extremes. An expanding beaver range is an ecosystem feedback to climate change which could improve water quality.},

  abstract = {Through their dam-building activities and subsequent water storage, beaver have the potential to restore riparian ecosystems and offset some of the predicted effects of climate change by modulating streamflow. Thus, it is not surprising that reintroducing beaver to watersheds from which they have been extirpated is an often-used restoration and climate-adaptation strategy. Identifying sites for reintroduction, however, requires detailed information about habitat factors---information that is not often available at broad spatial scales. Here we explore the potential for beaver relocation throughout the Snohomish River Basin in Washington, USA with a model that identifies some of the basic building blocks of beaver habitat suitability and does so by relying solely on remotely sensed data. More specifically, we developed a generalized intrinsic potential model that draws on remotely sensed measures of stream gradient, stream width, and valley width to identify where beaver could become established if suitable vegetation were to be present. Thus, the model serves as a preliminary screening tool that can be applied over relatively large extents. We applied the model to 5,019 stream km and assessed the ability of the model to correctly predict beaver habitat by surveying for beavers in 352 stream reaches. To further assess the potential for relocation, we assessed land ownership, use, and land cover in the landscape surrounding stream reaches with varying levels of intrinsic potential. Model results showed that 33\% of streams had moderate or high intrinsic potential for beaver habitat. We found that no site that was classified as having low intrinsic potential had any sign of beavers and that beaver were absent from nearly three quarters of potentially suitable sites, indicating that there are factors preventing the local population from occupying these areas. Of the riparian areas around streams with high intrinsic potential for beaver, 38\% are on public lands and 17\% are on large tracts of privately-owned timber land. Thus, although there are a large number of areas that could be suitable for relocation and restoration using beavers, current land use patterns may substantially limit feasibility in these areas.},

  abstract = {Water in rivers is delivered via the critical zone (CZ)---the living skin of the Earth, extending from the top of the vegetation canopy through the soil and down to fresh bedrock and the bottom of significantly active groundwater. Consequently, the success of stream-rearing salmonids depends on the structure and resulting water storage and release processes of this zone. Physical processes below the land surface (the subsurface component of the CZ) ultimately determine how landscapes ``filter'' climate to manifest ecologically significant streamflow and temperature regimes. Subsurface water storage capacity of the CZ has emerged as a key hydrologic variable that integrates many of these subsurface processes, helping to explain flow regimes and terrestrial plant community composition. Here, we investigate how subsurface storage controls flow, temperature, and energetic regimes that matter for salmonids. We illustrate the explanatory power of broadly applicable, storage-based frameworks across a lithological gradient that spans the Eel River watershed of California. Study sites are climatically similar but differ in their geologies and consequent subsurface CZ structure that dictates water storage dynamics, leading to dramatically different hydrographs, temperature, and riparian regimes---with consequences for every aspect of salmonid life history. Lithological controls on the development of key subsurface CZ properties like storage capacity suggest a heretofore unexplored link between salmonids and geology, adding to a rich literature that highlights various fluvial and geomorphic influences on salmonid diversity and distribution. Rapidly advancing methods for estimating and observing subsurface water storage dynamics at large scales present new opportunities for more clearly identifying landscape features that constrain the distributions and abundances of organisms, including salmonids, at watershed scales.},

To inform this strategy, we conducted a global synthesis and meta-analysis to identify general patterns of carbon stock accumulation in riparian forests. We compiled riparian biomass and soil carbon stock data from 117 publications, reports, and unpublished data sets. We then modeled the change in carbon stock as a function of vegetation age, considering effects of climate and whether or not the riparian forest had been actively planted. On average, our models predicted that the establishment of riparian forest will more than triple the baseline, unforested soil carbon stock, and that riparian forests hold on average 68--158 Mg C/ha in biomass at maturity, with the highest values in relatively warm and wet climates. We also found that actively planting riparian forest substantially jump-starts the biomass carbon accumulation, with initial growth rates more than double those of naturally regenerating riparian forest. Our results demonstrate that carbon sequestration should be considered a strong co-benefit of riparian restoration, and that increasing the pace and scale of riparian forest restoration may be a valuable investment providing both immediate carbon sequestration value and long-term ecosystem service returns.},

  abstract = {Beaver dams are gaining popularity as a low-tech, low-cost strategy to build climate resiliency at the landscape scale. They slow and store water that can be accessed by riparian vegetation during dry periods, effectively protecting riparian ecosystems from droughts. Whether or not this protection extends to wildfire has been discussed anecdotally but has not been examined in a scientific context. We used remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data to compare riparian vegetation greenness in areas with and without beaver damming during wildfire. We include data from five large wildfires of varying burn severity and dominant landcover settings in the western United States in our analysis. We found that beaver-dammed riparian corridors are relatively unaffected by wildfire when compared to similar riparian corridors without beaver damming. On average, the decrease in NDVI during fire in areas without beaver is 3.05 times as large as it is in areas with beaver. However, plant greenness rebounded in the year after wildfire regardless of beaver activity. Thus, we conclude that, while beaver activity does not necessarily play a role in riparian vegetation post-fire resilience, it does play a significant role in riparian vegetation fire resistance and refugia creation.},

  abstract = {Fish habitat is essential to the stability and productivity of fisheries. In Canada, the primary legal tool for protecting fish habitat is the federal Fisheries Act. In 2012, this law was changed to narrow the scope of habitat protection. The government's position was that the previous regime went beyond what was necessary to protect fish and fish habitat. Here, we tested that assertion by examining Fisheries Act authorizations to harmfully alter, disrupt, or destroy fish habitat issued by Fisheries and Oceans Canada during a 6-month period in 2012, obtained using access to information processes. We found the majority of projects (67\%) were authorized to impact more habitat than proponents were required to compensate for, likely resulting in a net loss of fish habitat. Our analysis show an aggregate net loss --- defined as authorized impact minus required compensation --- of 2\,919\,143 m               2               authorized across 78 projects. Drawing from these results, we present four recommendations for an improved habitat protection regime under a renewed Fisheries Act, emphasizing the need to establish a public registry for authorizations and monitoring data.},

  pages = {921--939},
  abstract = {Pacific salmon are important to the First Nations of the Skeena River watershed in British Columbia. The Skeena Fisheries Commission (SFC) was formed in 1985 through a memorandum of understanding between the watershed's five First Nations: Tsimshian, Gitxsan, Gitanyow, Wet'suwet'en, and Lake Babine. SFC focuses on salmon management, research, and conservation through governance and technical committees. This paper describes the development of fishery management capacity of SFC within the context of the cultural importance of salmon, the history of salmon management measures, and land claims. Capacity is analyzed in terms of the ability to perform eight management functions: policy making, negotiation and resource planning; stock assessment; fishery monitoring; enforcement and compliance; research, habitat and enhancement activities; data gathering and analysis for resource planning; creating benefits for fishermen and communities; and training and education. Policy making, negotiating, and planning occur between SFC and the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) through formal and informal consultations and monthly technical meetings. SFC also participates in committees at the federal and international levels. Stock assessment activities include spawner enumerations, counting weirs, mark-recapture studies, hydroacoustic surveys, and sampling fish for genetic stock identification. Catch monitoring of the food fishery has been regularly conducted since 1991. First Nation Rangers and federal Fisheries Officers enforce traditional and federal law, respectively. Member First Nations conduct research projects with assistance from SFC staff and infrastructure. Habitat and conservation enhancement projects include road culvert assessments and hatchery rearing of Kitwanga Lake sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka. The creation of benefits for communities occurs through two in-river fisheries. Finally, training and education include SFC-run workshops and specialized training by external sources. SFC will conduct most management functions in the future; however, funding remains a constraint to program expansion. Key elements of the success of the SFC include: the cultural imperative to protect fish, the community origin and leadership of the SFC, a favorable political environment, the early recognition of the need for a watershed-wide organization, and the availability of government funding.},

  year = {2009},
  abstract = {The harvest of westslope cutthroat trout from classified waters in the East Kootenay region of British Columbia is highly restricted. However, angling pressure has increased significantly on these streams in recent years. This monitoring study was initiated by the British Columbia Ministry of Environment in response to concern that mortality or injury resulting from catch-and-release angling may begin to adversely affect westslope cutthroat trout populations and degrade the angling experience. In August and September, 2008, westslope cutthroat trout abundance in index sections of the Wigwam River, Michel Creek, and St. Mary River were assessed using snorkeling surveys. Trout density estimates for the index sections and for the entire streams were generated from snorkeling counts and mark-recapture estimates of snorkeling count accuracy made during previous studies, and compared to previous density estimates where possible. Among study streams, Michel Creek and the lower St. Mary River had significantly higher estimated densities (per stream kilometer) of trout {$>$}300 mm than did the Wigwam River and upper St. Mary River. In addition to having the highest westslope cutthroat trout densities, Michel Creek also had the highest estimated densities of large trout {$>$}400 mm. In the Wigwam River, westslope cutthroat trout densities were higher in upstream reaches and lower in an downstream reach relative to 2001 and 2002, but the overall population size estimates for fish {$>$}300 mm were comparable. In the lower St. Mary River, the mean density of cutthroat trout {$>$}300 mm had more than doubled since the time of lowest recorded densities in 1989 and 1990, but was still significantly lower than the highest recorded density estimate from 1982. Evidence of hooking injury, in the form of facial damage or bruising, could not be reliably detected in the St. Mary River but was obvious and widespread in the Wigwam River and especially Michel Creek.}

We examined the relationship between six temperature metrics describing the growth (optimal growth temperature and final temperature preferendum), survival (upper incipient lethal temperature and critical thermal maximum), and reproduction (optimum spawning temperature and optimum egg development temperature) requirements of 87 Canadian freshwater fish species. Our results suggest that all metrics were highly correlated, especially those within each life process. Values for different metrics fell into distinct groups that were associated with thermal preference classes, reproductive guilds, and spawning season. These results suggest that it may be possible to estimate missing metric values using known values. This compilation of metrics provides easy access to information for a broad range of fish species common to North America and should foster more extensive use of this information in fish ecology.},

Although stream ecologists know that river channel and floodplain habitats used by aquatic organisms are maintained by hydrologic regimes that mobilize gravel-bed sediments, terrestrial ecologists have largely been unaware of the importance of floodplain structures and processes to the life requirements of a wide variety of species. We provide insight into gravel-bed rivers as the ecological nexus of glaciated mountain landscapes. We show why gravel-bed river floodplains are the primary arena where interactions take place among aquatic, avian, and terrestrial species from microbes to grizzly bears and provide essential connectivity as corridors for movement for both aquatic and terrestrial species. Paradoxically, gravel-bed river floodplains are also disproportionately unprotected where human developments are concentrated. Structural modifications to floodplains such as roads, railways, and housing and hydrologic-altering hydroelectric or water storage dams have severe impacts to floodplain habitat diversity and productivity, restrict local and regional connectivity, and reduce the resilience of both aquatic and terrestrial species, including adaptation to climate change. To be effective, conservation efforts in glaciated mountain landscapes intended to benefit the widest variety of organisms need a paradigm shift that has gravel-bed rivers and their floodplains as the central focus and that prioritizes the maintenance or restoration of the intact structure and processes of these critically important systems throughout their length and breadth.},

  abstract = {Executive summary: Ecological connectivity is the unimpeded movement of species and the flow of natural processes that sustain life on Earth. This definition has been endorsed by the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS, 2020) and underlines the urgency of protecting connectivity and its various elements, including dispersal, seasonal migration, fluvial processes and the connectivity that is inherently present in large wild areas. Fragmentation caused by human activities continues to disrupt habitats, threatening biodiversity and impeding climate change adaptation. A large body of science and theory has been developing to address this problem in the context of protected areas. The purpose of these Guidelines for Conserving Connectivity through Ecological Networks and Corridors is to consolidate this wealth of knowledge and best-available practices to support efforts to combat fragmentation. These Guidelines provide tools and examples (1) for applying ecological connectivity between protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and (2) for developing ecological networks for conservation. In doing so, these Guidelines advance best practices for protecting ecological networks that maintain, enhance and restore connectivity across both intact and human-dominated systems. As demand grows for innovative solutions at international, national and subnational levels, these Guidelines recommend formal recognition of ecological corridors to develop conservation networks and thus ensure effective conservation of biological diversity. Key messages {$\bullet$} Science overwhelmingly shows that interconnected protected areas and other areas for biological diversity conservation are much more effective than disconnected areas in human-dominated systems, especially in the face of climate change. {$\bullet$} Although it is well understood that ecological connectivity is critical to the conservation of biodiversity, approaches to identify, retain and enhance ecological connectivity have been scattered and inconsistent. At the same time, countries on every continent, along with regional and local governments, have advanced various forms of corridor legislation and policy to enhance connectivity. {$\bullet$} It is imperative that the world moves toward a coherent global approach for ecological connectivity conservation, and begins to measure and monitor the effectiveness of efforts to protect connectivity and thereby achieve functional ecological networks. To promote these goals, these Guidelines define ecological corridors as ways to identify, maintain, enhance and restore connectivity; summarise a large body of related science; and recommend means to formalise ecological corridors and networks.},

Immersive visualizations and experiences offer an intuitive, visceral approach to otherwise rather abstract concepts, but creating them scientifically is challenging. In this paper, we linked ecological modeling, procedural modeling, and virtual reality to provide an immersive experience of a future forest. We mapped current tree species composition in northern Wisconsin using the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data and then forecast forest change 50~years into the future under two climate scenarios using LANDIS-II, a spatially-explicit, mechanistic simulation model. We converted the model output (e.g., tree biomass) into parameters required for 3D visualizations with analytical modeling. Procedural rules allowed us to efficiently and reproducibly translate the parameters into a simulated forest. Data visualization, environment exploration, and information retrieval were realized using the Unreal Engine. A system evaluation with experts in ecology provided positive feedback and future topics for a comprehensive ecosystem visualization and analysis approach. Our approach to create visceral experiences of forests under climate change can facilitate communication among experts, policy-makers, and the general public.},

Based on the growth characteristic of macrophytes, we propose an approach for the assessment of the optimal biomass of macrophytes in the decay and growth periods in Lake Datong (a shallow lake), using a lake ecological model. The results showed that the pollution load of the lake should be reduced by 50\% while conforming to the Environmental Quality Standards for Surface Water (EQSSW) Class III. In contrast, with an increase in the pollution load of 5\%, the results indicate that the lake may deteriorate to a turbid state over the next few years. The macrophyte biomass should be harvested during the decay period, when 80\% biomass is beneficial to the water quality of the eutrophic shallow lake. Based on macrophyte simulation from 2020--2024, the wet biomass of macrophytes should be controlled at 5.5 kg/m2. The current macrophyte biomass in Lake Datong is four-fold higher than the simulated optimal biomass. This study provides a reference for the adequate ecological restoration of the lake and its subsequent maintenance, as well as scientific support for improving the comprehensive evaluation standard of healthy lakes and the theoretical basis of lake ecological restoration.},

  abstract = {We estimated dry season survival of imperiled salmonids in an intermittent coastal stream in California across 4 years (2009--2012). Our study encompassed two dry and two wet winters, allowing us to explore patterns of survival across and within dry seasons with different antecedent precipitation. Apparent survival of age-0+ steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) was higher following wet winters compared with dry winters. Moreover, antecedent precipitation was positively correlated with cumulative survival of age-0+ steelhead. Within years, apparent survival of steelhead varied among weeks with a tendency to decrease in the late summer, indicating that fish exhibited some resistance to seasonal drought. Additionally, we found a slight but significant survival advantage for age-0+ coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) compared with equal-aged steelhead. Our results emphasize the influence of antecedent precipitation in driving the survival of imperiled salmonids and highlight that these fishes are somewhat resistant to seasonal drought, at least to a point.},

Sagittal otoliths were collected from 605 fish ranging in size from 36 to 250 mm (fork length). The maximum detected age (13 years for females and 12 for males) was higher than has been reported previously in published literature; but no significant differences in age distributions between males and females were found. Length growth rates, estimated using the von Bertalanffy growth function, showed that males and females had similar growth rates. Sex ratios varied between 0{$\cdot$}3 to 2{$\cdot$}0 females per male. Age and size at 50\% maturity were greater for females than males (4{$\cdot$}9 years and 139 mm v. 3{$\cdot$}7 years and 125 mm). Mature females were yearly spawners with highly variable fecundities (mean {\textpm} S.D. = 223 {\textpm}94) and their ovaries contained both developed and undeveloped eggs. Across all populations, mean instantaneous mortality rate (Z) was estimated as 0{$\cdot$}555, annual survival rates for 0--1 year-old fish were 3{$\cdot$}2\% and 57{$\cdot$}4\% for older fish. An altitudinal distribution gradient was observed, with older fish occupying upper stream reaches. This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of biological characteristics and structure of O. c. lewisi populations inhabiting small, mountain streams and should provide useful basic information for management policies of this threatened species in eastern drainage of the Canadian Rocky Mountains.}

  abstract = {River management based solely on physical science has proven to be unsustainable and unsuccessful, evidenced by the fact that the problems this approach intended to solve (e.g., flood hazards, water scarcity, and channel instability) have not been solved and long-term deterioration in river environments has reduced the capacity of rivers to continue meeting the needs of society. In response, there has been a paradigm shift in management over the past few decades, towards river restoration. But the ecological, morphological, and societal benefits of river restoration have, on the whole, been disappointing. We believe that this stems from the fact that restoration overrelies on the same physical analyses and approaches, with flowing water still regarded as the universally predominant driver of channel form and structural intervention seen as essential to influencing fluvial processes. We argue that if river restoration is to reverse long-standing declines in river functions, it is necessary to recognize the influence of biology on river forms and processes and re-envisage what it means to restore a river. This entails shifting the focus of river restoration from designing and constructing stable channels that mimic natural forms to reconnecting streams within balanced and healthy biomes, and so levering the power of biology to influence river processes. We define this new approach as biomic river restoration.},

  abstract = {When inundated by floodwaters, river floodplains provide critical habitat for many species of fish and wildlife, but many river valleys have been extensively leveed and floodplain wetlands drained for flood control and agriculture. In the Central Valley of California, USA, where less than 5\% of floodplain wetland habitats remain, a critical conservation question is how can farmland occupying the historical floodplains be better managed to improve benefits for native fish and wildlife. In this study fields on the Sacramento River floodplain were intentionally flooded after the autumn rice harvest to determine if they could provide shallow-water rearing habitat for Sacramento River fall-run Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Approximately 10,000 juvenile fish (ca. 48 mm, 1.1 g) were reared on two hectares for six weeks (Feb-March) between the fall harvest and spring planting. A subsample of the fish were uniquely tagged to allow tracking of individual growth rates (average 0.76 mm/day) which were among the highest recorded in fresh water in California. Zooplankton sampled from the water column of the fields were compared to fish stomach contents. The primary prey was zooplankton in the order Cladocera, commonly called water fleas. The compatibility, on the same farm fields, of summer crop production and native fish habitat during winter demonstrates that land management combining agriculture with conservation ecology may benefit recovery of native fish species, such as endangered Chinook salmon.},

  abstract = {Use of lake habitats by ocean-type Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha is rare under natural conditions. We studied aspects of the trophic ecology of naturally and hatchery-produced juvenile Chinook salmon rearing in the littoral zone of highly urbanized Lake Washington in Washington State. During February through May, naturally produced juvenile Chinook salmon occupied littoral habitats and consumed mostly epibenthic prey, primarily chironomid pupae (Diptera). In June, they switched to a diet dominated by plankton, specifically Daphnia spp. This diet shift from littoral prey to limnetic prey coincided with increasing temperature, a shift by the fish from littoral to limnetic habitats, the spring bloom of Daphnia, and increasing fish size. Bioenergetics modeling for these populations estimated that naturally produced juvenile Chinook salmon had high consumption rates and were generally feeding close to their maximum ration, even after large numbers of hatchery-produced Chinook salmon entered the lake. The feeding rates, growth rates, and proportions of maximum daily ration from the modeling suggested that under current conditions, both naturally produced and hatchery-produced juvenile Chinook salmon were finding ample food in littoral habitats of Lake Washington. These results further reveal that hatchery-produced Chinook salmon did not compete with naturally produced fish and that this was probably a result of hatchery juveniles entering the lake during the spring Daphnia bloom when this prey is abundant. Our results suggest that managers should focus Chinook salmon recovery efforts in the Lake Washington basin on other aspects of the species' lake use, such as predation or disease, or on other life stages (e.g., spawning adults).},

There was minimal bias ({\`A}2.5\%) in diver estimates of the fork lengths of juvenile steelhead, and the relationship between measured and estimated fork lengths was very precise (r2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 95\%). With a hierarchical Bayesian model, estimates of the detection probability for smaller juveniles (40--60 mm) ranged from 0.4 to 0.6 with electrofishing and were near zero with snorkeling. In contrast, snorkeling-based detection probability was 0.6 and independent of size for larger juvenile steelhead (.60 mm) and much greater than that with electrofishing. These results provide strong evidence that there is considerable individual heterogeneity in detection probability driven by fish size for both methods. Owing to these differences, the abundance of age-0 steelhead based on snorkeling was underestimated by 50\%, but that of larger, age-1 fish was unbiased and more precise (10-fold) than that based on electrofishing. The use of electrofishing during marking resulted in a substantive reduction in snorkeling-based detection probability during recapture, but the converse was not true. Thus, there is strong evidence of behavioral heterogeneity in detection probability induced by electrofishing, but only when snorkeling is used to detect fish during recapture. The differences in detection probabilities among size-classes and sampling methods were probably driven by differences in concealment behavior, spatial distribution, and fright responses to sampling. Our results indicate that snorkeling is the better way to estimate abundance for larger juvenile steelhead, whereas electrofishing is preferred for smaller fish.},

  abstract = {Estimating riverwide abundance of juvenile fish populations is challenging because detection probability is typically low and juveniles can be patchily distributed over large areas. We used a hierarchical Bayesian model to estimate the abundance of juvenile steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss in two rivers in British Columbia over 3 years based on a multigear, two-phase sampling design. These estimates were used to drive a simulation model to evaluate how the precision of abundance estimates varied with the number of single-pass index and mark--recapture sites that were sampled, the proportion of shoreline sampled, and the mean and variation of detection probability and fish density across sites. The extent of variation in fish densities across index sites was the most important factor influencing the precision of river-wide abundance estimates, and increasing the number of index sites was the best approach to reduce variability in abundance estimates. River size, which controls the proportion of habitat sampled for a given level of sampling effort, had a moderate effect on precision, but only when the extent of site-to-site variation in fish density was high. Factors affecting detection probability, such as the number of mark--recapture sites, the mean detection probability, or the extent of variation in detection probability across sites, had much less influence on precision of abundance estimates unless the proportion of river sampled was high. Hierarchical Bayesian models are no substitute for collecting informative data, but they improve our understanding of variance structure, which is critical for providing realistic estimates of uncertainty and designing informative and efficient sampling programs.},

  abstract = {The concept of ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) has been subjected to debate since it was introduced in the late 1990s. The development of the concept seems to follow two separate but simultaneous trajectories of increased popularity but also sustained critique. This paper offers an analysis of potential mechanisms behind these disparate trajectories by drawing on a theoretical framework from science and technology studies (STS) centred around "black box" and actor-network theory. To support our analysis, we perform an exploratory literature review of how the EBFM concept has been used in a selection of high impact fisheries research papers. We find that the popularity of EBFM does not guarantee its integrity, usefulness or analytical insight, but also that persistent critique of how the concept is used seems to be driving some change. We think that a continued trajectory of increased understanding, contextualization and discernibility of EBFM can help overcome the considerable ambiguity associated with the concept and make it increasingly useful to fisheries management. This means moving away from routine use of the term towards a practicable and tangible approach to improve fisheries sustainability.},

We observed larger average otolith growth increments, higher prey densities, and warmer water temperatures in both offchannel ponds and non-natal seasonal tributaries compared to the main-channel areas in both 2001 and 2002. Our findings suggest that warmer temperatures and abundant prey in off-channel habitats during Central Valley Chinook salmon rearing periods may lead to higher growth rates, which in turn may improve juvenile survival.

  abstract = {Conservation efforts for Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) increasingly prioritize maintenance of cool water temperatures that protect all freshwater life stages. However, development of appropriate temperature standards requires a robust understanding of the interactions among water temperature, ecosystem productivity, and fish performance. We used a series of in situ enclosures to examine how natural spatiotemporal gradients in thermal conditions and prey availability affected the summer growth and survival of age-0+ coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). Coho salmon absolute growth rates peaked at a mean daily average water temperature (mean T) of 16.6 {$^\circ$}C and an associated maximum weekly maximum temperature (MWMT) of 21.1 {$^\circ$}C. Juvenile growth under these thermal conditions was sixfold greater than the growth rates observed for conspecifics rearing in the coolest study reach (mean T = 13.0 {$^\circ$}C; MWMT = 16.0 {$^\circ$}C). Even at the highest rearing temperature (mean T = 18.1 {$^\circ$}C; MWMT = 24.0 {$^\circ$}C), growth rates remained positive and above the study-wide average, although overall survival was reduced. Among the predictor variables examined, invertebrate prey abundance was the predominant factor influencing age-0+ coho salmon growth. These results suggest that abundant prey resources may mitigate the negative effects of elevated water temperature on fish growth in riverine environments. Given the likelihood of increasing stream temperatures with climate change, productive ecosystems may provide critical refuges for juvenile salmonids.},

  abstract = {The construction of beaver dams facilitates a suite of hydrologic, hydraulic, geomorphic, and ecological feedbacks that increase stream complexity and channel--floodplain connectivity that benefit aquatic and terrestrial biota. Depending on where beaver build dams within a drainage network, they impact lateral and longitudinal connectivity by introducing roughness elements that fundamentally change the timing, delivery, and storage of water, sediment, nutrients, and organic matter. While the local effects of beaver dams on streams are well understood, broader coverage network models that predict where beaver dams can be built and highlight their impacts on connectivity across diverse drainage networks are lacking. Here we present a capacity model to assess the limits of riverscapes to support dam-building activities by beaver across physiographically diverse landscapes. We estimated dam capacity with freely and nationally-available inputs to evaluate seven lines of evidence: (1) reliable water source, (2) riparian vegetation conducive to foraging and dam building, (3) vegetation within 100 m of edge of stream to support expansion of dam complexes and maintain large colonies, (4) likelihood that channel-spanning dams could be built during low flows, (5) the likelihood that a beaver dam is likely to withstand typical floods, (6) a suitable stream gradient that is neither too low to limit dam density nor too high to preclude the building or persistence of dams, and (7) a suitable river that is not too large to restrict dam building or persistence. Fuzzy inference systems were used to combine these controlling factors in a framework that explicitly also accounts for model uncertainty. The model was run for 40,561 km of streams in Utah, USA, and portions of surrounding states, predicting an overall network capacity of 356,294 dams at an average capacity of 8.8 dams/km. We validated model performance using 2852 observed dams across 1947 km of streams. The model showed excellent agreement with observed dam densities where beaver dams were present. Model performance was spatially coherent and logical, with electivity indices that effectively segregated capacity categories. That is, beaver dams were not found where the model predicted no dams could be supported, beaver avoided segments that were predicted to support rare or occasional densities, and beaver preferentially occupied and built dams in areas predicted to have pervasive dam densities. The resulting spatially explicit reach-scale (250 m long reaches) data identifies where dam-building activity is sustainable, and at what densities dams can occur across a landscape. As such, model outputs can be used to determine where channel--floodplain and wetland connectivity are likely to persist or expand by promoting increases in beaver dam densities.},

The proposed approach uses a parameter that serves as a mechanism for guiding multicriteria evaluation procedures. The parameter is incorporated into a method for obtaining the optimal order weights and for developing a transformation function. The function provides us with a consistent way of modifying the criterion values so that the multicriteria combination procedures can be guided by specifying a single parameter. The parameterized-OWA method has been implemented in a GIS environment as a GIS--OWA module and it has been tested in a real-world situation for developing management strategies in the Cedar Creek watershed in Ontario, Canada. Given a set of evaluation criteria, the problem is to evaluate areas in the watershed for rehabilitation and enhancement projects. Using the GIS--OWA method, a number of alternative strategies for rehabilitation and enhancement projects have been generated and evaluated.},

  abstract = {Our aim was to determine how beavers affect habitats and food resources for juvenile salmon in the Kwethluk River in western Alaska. 1. Habitat modification by beavers was quantified using 3 years of satellite imagery to assess the amount and spatial distribution of potential juvenile rearing habitat. Macroinvertebrate community composition and juvenile salmon abundance in beaver ponds, spring brooks with and without upstream beaver dams, and main channel shorelines were quantified to determine beaver influence. Presence of beaver dams and time-series measures of water levels were used to assess hydrological connectivity and fish access between the sites and the river as modified by beavers. 2. Of the off-channel aquatic habitat, 87.5\% was altered by beavers damming spring brooks. All beaver-free and beaver-influenced juvenile salmon habitats had similar physical characteristics [by non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination], indicating that all are suitable as juvenile salmon rearing habitat. 3. Aquatic macroinvertebrate community composition differed between beaver ponds and spring brooks (by NMDS ordination) with differences driven by larval stoneflies in spring brooks compared to cladocerans, copepods and freshwater clams in beaver ponds. 4. Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and coho (O. kisutch) salmon were predominant in all habitat types except late-successional ponds. Total fish species and salmon species richness was 2--39 higher, the proportion of young-of-the-year salmon was over 50\% compared to {$<$}5\%, and densities of juvenile salmon were 5--79 higher in spring brooks and early-successional ponds compared to latesuccessional ponds. 5. Early-successional ponds had high hydrological synchrony values (closely tracking water fluctuations in the main channel), while mid- and late-successional ponds, being farther from the main channel and with more dams blocking flow paths, had lower and highly variable synchrony values. Almost no movement of juvenile salmon occurred past dams at base flow. However, summer and autumn flooding mediated movement past dams, allowing individuals to `escape' or enter early-successional ponds. 6. Beavers reduced habitat connectivity and added variability to macroinvertebrate assemblages within habitats by damming floodplain spring brooks. Nonetheless, juvenile salmon were able to effectively inhabit and move between early-successional ponds and spring brooks in the Kwethluk River, although the presence of beaver dams strongly limited the use of late-successional ponds on the large alluvial river floodplain.},

  abstract = {Beavers (Castor canadensis) may strongly influence juvenile salmon production by damming spring brooks that are primary rearing habitats on expansive floodplains of large Pacific Rim salmon rivers. We studied three floodplain rearing habitats in the Kwethluk River, Alaska: free-flowing (beaver-free, n = 3) and beaver-influenced (below beaver dams, n = 4) spring brooks and early-successional beaver ponds (n = 4). We analyzed juvenile coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytschwa) salmon movement, survival, densities, and growth using a multistate robust capture--mark--recapture design. Survival (46\% to 80\%) and densities (0.9 fish{$\cdot$}m-2) were highest in beaver-free spring brooks. Ponds had lower salmon densities, producing less biomass per unit area than beaver-influenced or beaver-free spring brooks (1.87 {\textpm} 0.57 g{$\cdot$}m-2 vs. 2.98 {\textpm} 1.22 and 3.23 {\textpm} 0.73 g{$\cdot$}m-2). However, ponds covered 2{\texttimes} greater area than either type of spring brook and therefore produced more salmon biomass at the floodplain scale than either type of spring brook (175 kg vs. 149 kg in beaver-influenced spring brooks and 140 kg in beaver-free spring brooks). We conclude that beaver damming of floodplain spring brooks produces bigger juveniles and more total biomass, but spring brooks produce significantly more, albeit smaller, coho and Chinook juveniles. Thus, the presence of beavers on the floodplain increases habitat variation, which provides a larger range of growth opportunities for juvenile salmon.},

Comments on the document were solicited from the public. Here I comment on this document on behalf of Timberwolf Wilderness Society and FWR Freshwater Research Limited. The comments focus, in no particular order, on {$\bullet$} to what extent the document meets the requirements of the SARA, as itemized above, and {$\bullet$} to what extent the proposals constitute good conservation science that could be expected to recover the species sufficiently so that it reasonably could be delisted. In brief, I make the following main points. {$\bullet$} The document does not meet several of the requirements specified under the Species At Risk Act. In part this may be due to conflating the requirements and purposes of the recovery strategy and the action plan, which the Act contemplates as distinct functions. The document would benefit from separating these two topics into distinct sections and addressing the SARA requirements of each separately. {$\bullet$} The strategic goal of the recovery program skirts the need to actually recover the species, the entire purpose of the Species At Risk Act. The stated goal does not provide a quantitative target against which progress can be measured, and which can be used to determine objectively when the program has been successful. I make several suggestions about how to correct this problem. {$\bullet$} The definition of critical habitat and its geographic identification are internally contradictory, which will make management difficult and enforcement of SARA protections next to impossible. The science, if any, supporting the critical habitat work is not publicly available, so it is not clear whether the decisions regarding critical habitat are defensible. The recognition of critical habitat as extending into the terrestrial realm and upstream to the watershed boundary is a major improvement over the very limited identification of critical habitat given in the previous recovery strategy. Unfortunately, this section goes on to restrict critical habitat only to locations with the attributes listed in a table. None of the locations are actually identified on the maps, leaving critical habitat completely unidentified. The suggested correction is to identify the watershed and stream network above the lowest-elevation location holding pure cutthroats, including the terrestrial and aquatic realms, as critical habitat. {$\bullet$} No actual recovery actions are proposed after as much as six years of planning, but are urgently needed. Critical problem areas are known, as are cost-effective, proven solutions. Existing populations are far too small to survive, and are at very high risk of extirpation even in the short term. They must be enlarged. The only means of enlarging them sufficiently is to provide additional secure habitat free from hybridizing or competing species. Do it, or lose populations critical for successful recovery, one by one.}

The Government of Canada has prepared a recovery strategy for the subspecies unit in Alberta. This report was prepared on behalf of the Timberwolf Wilderness Society as a supplement to the Alberta Government recovery plan, and as a response to the Government of Canada's request for comment on its proposed recovery strategy.

  abstract = {The diversity of life in headwater streams (intermittent, first and second order) contributes to the biodiversity of a river system and its riparian network. Small streams differ widely in physical, chemical, and biotic attributes, thus providing habitats for a range of unique species. Headwater species include permanent residents as well as migrants that travel to headwaters at particular seasons or life stages. Movement by migrants links headwaters with downstream and terrestrial ecosystems, as do exports such as emerging and drifting insects. We review the diversity of taxa dependent on headwaters. Exemplifying this diversity are three unmapped headwaters that support over 290 taxa. Even intermittent streams may support rich and distinctive biological communities, in part because of the predictability of dry periods. The influence of headwaters on downstream systems emerges from their attributes that meet unique habitat requirements of residents and migrants by: offering a refuge from temperature and flow extremes, competitors, predators, and introduced species; serving as a source of colonists; providing spawning sites and rearing areas; being a rich source of food; and creating migration corridors throughout the landscape. Degradation and loss of headwaters and their connectivity to ecosystems downstream threaten the biological integrity of entire river networks.},

To minimize mortality from freshwater angling, fish are often stocked in the fall when the fishing season is almost finished. In the fall of 1994--1998, we experimentally stocked hatchery-reared age-0 masu salmon (mean weights, 4.1--13.9 g) in the Masuhoro River of northern Japan. Mark--recapture experiments were conducted to estimate the numbers of hatchery-origin masu salmon smolts in the spring. Numbers of masu salmon parr in the river were estimated in July 1998--1999 when the smolt runs were almost finished. The proportion of fish smolting at age 1 (2.2--15.7\%) was positively correlated with mean weight at release. Overwinter survival (9.0--17.0\%) was also correlated with fish weight at release. Our study showed that size at release is an important factor when stocking age-0 masu salmon in the fall to maximize the number of smolts produced and thereby support marine fisheries.},

The main intent of this layer is to have a single layer of all known obstacles to fish passage. It is important to note that not all waterbodies have been studied and, not all lengths of many waterbodies have been studied so there are a very high number of obstacles in the real world that are not recorded in this dataset. This layer simply reports the obstacles to fish that are known.  It is also very important to note that we are acknowledging these features as obstacles to fish passage versus barriers to fish passage.  This is because an obstacle may be a barrier at one time of year but not at other times depending on the volume of water present and also, what is a barrier to one species of fish is not necessarily a barrier to another species.},

  abstract = {Hungry Horse Dam on the South Fork Flathead River, Montana, USA, has modified the natural flow regimen for power generation, flood risk management and flow augmentation for anadromous fish recovery in the Columbia River. Concern over the detrimental effects of dam operations on native resident fishes prompted research to quantify the impacts of alternative flow management strategies on threatened bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) and westslope cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi) habitats. Seasonal and life-stage specific habitat suitability criteria were combined with a two-dimensional hydrodynamic habitat model to assess discharge effects on usable habitats. Telemetry data used to construct seasonal habitat suitability curves revealed that subadult (fish that emigrated from natal streams to the river system) bull trout move to shallow, low-velocity shoreline areas at night, which are most sensitive to flow fluctuations. Habitat time series analyses comparing the natural flow regimen (predam, 1929--1952) with five postdam flow management strategies (1953--2008) show that the natural flow conditions optimize the critical bull trout habitats and that the current strategy best resembles the natural flow conditions of all postdam periods. Late summer flow augmentation for anadromous fish recovery, however, produces higher discharges than predam conditions, which reduces the availability of usable habitat during this critical growing season. Our results suggest that past flow management policies that created sporadic streamflow fluctuations were likely detrimental to resident salmonids and that natural flow management strategies will likely improve the chances of protecting key ecosystem processes and help to maintain and restore threatened bull trout and westslope cutthroat trout populations in the upper Columbia River Basin.

  abstract = {Invasive hybridization is one of the greatest threats to the persistence of Westslope Cutthroat Trout Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi. Large protected areas, where nonhybridized populations are interconnected and express historical life history and genetic diversity, provide some of the last ecological and evolutionary strongholds for conserving this species. Here, we describe the genetic status and distribution of Westslope Cutthroat Trout throughout Glacier National Park, Montana. Admixture between Westslope Cutthroat Trout and introduced Rainbow Trout O. mykiss and Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout O. clarkii bouvieri was estimated by genotyping 1,622 fish collected at 115 sites distributed throughout the Columbia, Missouri, and South Saskatchewan River drainages. Currently, Westslope Cutthroat Trout occupy an estimated 1,465 km of stream habitat and 45 lakes (9,218 ha) in Glacier National Park. There was no evidence of introgression in samples from 32 sites along 587 km of stream length (40\% of the stream kilometers currently occupied) and 17 lakes (2,555 ha; 46\% of the lake area currently occupied). However, nearly all (97\%) of the streams and lakes that were occupied by nonhybridized populations occurred in the Columbia River basin. Based on genetic status (nonnative genetic admixture {$\leq$} 10\%), 36 Westslope Cutthroat Trout populations occupying 821 km of stream and 5,482 ha of lakes were identified as ``conservation populations.'' Most of the conservation populations (N = 27; 736 km of stream habitat) occurred in the Columbia River basin, whereas only a few geographically restricted populations were found in the South Saskatchewan River (N = 7; 55 km) and Missouri River (N = 2; 30 km) basins. Westslope Cutthroat Trout appear to be at imminent risk of genomic extinction in the South Saskatchewan and Missouri River basins, whereas populations in the Columbia River basin are widely distributed and conservation efforts are actively addressing threats from hybridization and other stressors. A diverse set of pro-active management approaches will be required to conserve, protect, and restore Westslope Cutthroat Trout populations in Glacier National Park throughout the 21st century.

  abstract = {Beaver dam analogues (BDAs) are becoming an increasingly popular stream restoration technique. One ecological function BDAs might help restore is suitable habitat conditions for fish in streams where loss of beaver dams and channel incision has led to their decline. A critical physical characteristic for fish is stream temperature. We examined the thermal regime of a spring-fed Canadian Rocky Mountain stream in relation to different numbers of BDAs installed in series over three study periods (April--October; 2017--2019). While all BDA configurations significantly influenced stream and pond temperatures, single- and double-configuration BDAs incrementally increased stream temperatures. Single and double configuration BDAs warmed the downstream waters of mean maxima of 9.9, 9.3 {$^\circ$}C by respective mean maxima of 0.9 and 1.0 {$^\circ$}C. Higher pond and stream temperatures occurred when ponding and discharge decreased, and vice versa. In 2019, variation in stream temperature below double-configuration BDAs was lower than the single-configuration BDA. The triple-configuration BDA, in contrast, cooled the stream, although the mean maximum stream temperature was the highest below these structures. Ponding upstream of BDAs increased discharge and resulted in cooling of the stream. Rainfall events sharply and transiently reduced stream temperatures, leading to a three-way interaction between BDA configuration, rainfall and stream discharge as factors co-influencing the stream temperature regime. Our results have implications for optimal growth of regionally important and threatened bull and cutthroat trout fish species.},

Although the beaver-related restoration has broad appeal, especially in water-limited systems, its effectiveness is not yet well documented. In this article, we present a process-expectation framework that links beaver-related restoration tactics to commonly expected outcomes by identifying the set of process pathways that must occur to achieve those expected outcomes. We explore the contingency implicit within this framework using social and biophysical data from project and research sites. This analysis reveals that outcomes are often predicated on complex process pathways over which humans have limited control. Consequently, expectations often shift through the course of projects, suggesting that a more useful paradigm for evaluating process-based restoration would be to identify relevant processes and to rigorously document how projects do or do not proceed along expected process pathways using both quantitative and qualitative data.},

  abstract = {In this article, we demonstrate the application of a continuous confinement metric across entire river networks. Confinement is a useful metric for characterizing and discriminating valley setting. At the reach scale, valley bottom confinement is measured and quantified as the ratio of the length of channel confined on either bank by a confining margin divided by the reach length. The valley bottom is occupied by the contemporary floodplain and/or its channel(s); confining margins can be any landform or feature that makes up the valley bottom margin, such as bedrock hillslopes, terraces, fans, or anthropogenic features such as stopbanks or constructed levees. To test the reliability of calculating confinement across entire networks, we applied our geoprocessing scripts across four physiographically distinct watersheds of the Pacific Northwest, USA using freely available national datasets. Comparison of manually digitized and mapped with modeled calculations of confinement revealed that roughly one-third of reaches were equivalent and about two-thirds of the sites differ by less than {\textpm}15\%. A sensitivity analysis found that a 500 m reach segmentation length produced reasonable agreement with manual, categorical, expert-derived analysis of confinement. Confinement accuracy can be improved (c. 4\% to 17\% gains) using a more accurately mapped valley bottom and channel position (i.e. with higher-resolution model inputs). This is particularly important when differentiating rivers in the partly confined valley setting. However, at the watershed scale, patterns derived from mapping confinement are not fundamentally different, making this a reasonably accurate and rapid technique for analysis and measurement of confinement across broad spatial extents. {\copyright} 2019 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {The Coho Salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch, is one of seven species of Pacific salmon and trout native to northeastern Pacific Ocean watersheds. The species is typically anadromous; adults reproduce in fresh water where juveniles reside for 1--2 years before seaward migration after which the majority of growth occurs in the ocean before maturation at 2--4 years old when adults return to fresh water to spawn. Here, we report maturation of Coho Salmon in two freshwater lakes on the north coast of British Columbia apparently without their being to sea. A total of 15 mature fish (11 males and four females) were collected in two lakes across two years. The mature fish were all at least 29 cm in total length and ranged in age from three to five years old. The occurrence of Coho Salmon that have matured in fresh water without first going to sea is exceedingly rare in their natural range, especially for females. Such mature Coho Salmon may represent residual and distinct breeding populations from those in adjacent streams. Alternatively, they may result from the ephemeral restriction in the opportunity to migrate seaward owing to low water levels in the spring when Coho Salmon typically migrate to sea after 1--2 years in fresh water. Regardless of their origin, the ability to mature in fresh water without seaward migration may represent important adaptive life history plasticity in response to variable environments.},

  abstract = {River systems in the mountain western USA have been shaped by the presence of beavers for millennia. However, beavers have been extirpated from the landscape in many places, leading to excessive stream incision and streambank erosion. One common strategy to mitigate this issue is to deploy beaver dam analogue (BDAs) as a stream restoration technique. Although BDAs are intended to reduce erosion and stream incision, few studies directly document the impact of BDAs on stream channel geomorphology. This study, therefore, assesses how a complex of five BDAs along a 150 m long stream reach in Red Canyon Ranch near Lander, WY impacts stream bank erosion and deposition and channel evolution over a 1-year period post-installation. Relative to control locations not impacted by BDAs, the BDA reach showed greater spatial heterogeneity in erosion and deposition patterns than control locations, as well as less overall erosion. However, each BDA had unique effects on channel morphology. Large amounts of deposition were found at the most upstream BDA remaining after the first year at both inner and outer meander locations. High flow events created breaches that likely produced significant stream bank erosion observed immediately downstream of the BDA complex. From a design standpoint, the only BDAs that remained after a year were those built around fence posts inserted into the stream bed with a percussion fence post driver. Overall, our short-term data indicate that BDAs can be successfully used as a stream restoration practice to reduce stream bank erosion and increase channel geomorphological heterogeneity.},

Westslope Cutthroat Trout are now increasing in the Blackfoot River and several streams, including Nevada Spring Creek, where natural channel, flow, and temperature regimes have reestablished aquatic habitat and migration corridors. To examine whether restoration has improved corridors for migration, we tracked the movements of 14 adult Westslope Cutthroat Trout from wintering areas in lower Nevada Creek (downstream of Nevada Spring Creek) to spawning and summering areas. Ten fish moved through Nevada Spring Creek upstream a median distance of 7.7 km (range, 7.6--16.9) to spawning sites at the headwaters of Wasson Creek through stream reaches where channels were reconstructed, instream flows enhanced, and grazing practices improved. Eight of the 10 fish that entered Wasson Creek spawned in a concentrated area upstream of two experimental diversion--fish screen structures located in the main channel of Wasson Creek. Prespawning movements of the remaining four radio-tagged fish were much farther than those of Wasson Creek spawners (median, 51.8 km; range, 44.9--63.1). These four fish moved downstream through Nevada Creek into the Blackfoot River and then ascended upper Blackfoot River before entering two separate spawning tributaries. This telemetry study indicates that restoration can improve migration corridors which, in turn, promote the recovery of migratory Westslope Cutthroat Trout, and that spring-influenced tributaries like Nevada Spring Creek provide important overwinter habitat for Westslope Cutthroat Trout that spawn and summer elsewhere in the basin.},

  abstract = {Across Eurasia and North America, beaver (Castor spp), their dams and their human-built analogues are becoming increasingly common restoration tools to facilitate recovery of streams and wetlands, providing a natural and cost-effective means of restoring dynamic fluvial ecosystems. Although the use of beaver ponds by numerous fish and wildlife species is well documented, debate continues as to the benefits of beaver dams, primarily because dams are perceived as barriers to fish movement, particularly migratory species such as salmonids. In this study, through a series of field experiments, we tested the ability of juvenile salmonids to cross constructed beaver dams (aka beaver dam analogues). Two species, coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and steelhead trout (O. mykiss), were tracked using passive integrated transponder tags (PIT tags) as they crossed constructed beaver dam analogues. We found that when we tagged and moved these fishes from immediately upstream of the dams to immediately downstream of them, most were detected upstream within 36 hours of displacement. By the end of a 21-day field experiment, 91\% of the displaced juvenile coho and 54\% of the juvenile steelhead trout were detected on antennas upstream of the dams. In contrast, during the final week of the 21-day experiment, just 1 of 158 coho salmon and 6 of 40 (15\%) of the steelhead trout were still detected on antennas in the release pool below the dams. A similar but shorter 4-day pilot experiment with only steelhead trout produced similar results. In contrast, in a non-displacement experiment, juveniles of both species that were captured, tagged and released in a pool 50 m below the dams showed little inclination to move upstream. Further, by measuring hydraulic conditions at the major flowpaths over and around the dams, we provide insight into low-flow conditions under which juvenile salmonids are able to cross these constructed beaver dams, and that multiple types of flowpaths may be beneficial towards assisting fish movement past instream restoration structures. Finally, we compared estimates of the number of juvenile salmonids using the pond habitat upstream of the dam relative to the number that the dam may have prevented from moving upstream. Upstream of the dams we found an abundance of juvenile salmonids and a several orders of magnitude difference in favor of the number of juveniles using the pond habitat upstream of the dam. In sum, our study suggests beaver dams, BDAs, and other channel spanning habitat features should be preserved and restored rather than removed as perceived obstructions to fish passage.},

However, the population-level effects on coho salmon resulting from the widespread removal of millions of beaver and their dams from Pacific Coast watersheds have not been examined. We assessed the current and historic distributions of beaver ponds and other coho salmon rearing habitat in the Stillaguamish River, a 1,771-km2 drainage basin in Washington and found that the greatest reduction in coho salmon smolt production capacity originated from the extensive loss of beaver ponds. We estimated the current summer smolt production potential (SPP) to be 965,000 smolts, compared with a historic summer SPP of 2.5 million smolts. Overall, current summer habitat capacity was reduced by 61\% compared with historic levels, most of the reduction resulting from the loss of beaver ponds. Current summer SPP from beaver ponds and sloughs was reduced by 89\% and 68\%, respectively, compared with historic SPP. A more dramatic reduction in winter habitat capacity was found; the current winter SPP was estimated at 971,000 smolts, compared with a historic winter SPP of 7.1 million smolts. In terms of winter habitat capacity, we estimated a 94\% reduction in beaver pond SPP, a 68\% loss in SPP of sloughs, a 9\% loss in SPP of tributary habitat, and an overall SPP reduction of 86\%. Most of the overall reduction resulted from the loss of beaver ponds. Our analysis suggests that summer habitat historically limited smolt production capacity, whereas both summer and winter habitats currently exert equal limits on production. Watershed-scale restoration activities designed to increase coho salmon production should emphasize the creation of ponds and other slow-water environments; increasing beaver populations may be a simple and effective means of creating slow-water habitat.},

  year = {2011},
  abstract = {The incised and degraded habitat of Bridge Creek is thought to be limiting the population of ESA-listed steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss). A logical restoration intervention is to improve their habitat through reconnecting the channel with portions of its former floodplain (now terraces) to increase stream habitat complexity and the extent of riparian vegetation. Using conventional restoration techniques, such interventions often involve massive grading operations, major revegetation efforts, and are extremely expensive. Here, we seek to partner with a small, extant beaver population to restore geomorphic, hydrologic and ecological functions of this degraded system by helping beaver build longerlived dams. Currently, the beaver population appears limited because their dams are short-lived. Most beaver dams are constructed within the incision trench and during high discharge events the full force of flood waters are concentrated on these dams rather than dissipating across floodplains. Consequently most dams breach and fail within their first season. The primary hypothesis we are testing is that by working with beaver to create stable colonies and aggrade incised reaches of Bridge Creek, there will be measurable improvements in riparian and stream habitat conditions and abundance of native steelhead. The main restoration design challenge was is to help beaver build dams that would last long enough to lead to the establishment of stable colonies. If this can be accomplished, the beaver dams should promote enough aggradation to reverse channel incision and reap a number of well documented positive ecosystem feedbacks associated with dynamic beaver dam complexes that will benefit steelhead and other species.},

Models predicting species distributions can give insight into habitat requirements and expected probabilities of encountering species in unsampled areas, and help identify unique outlier populations and potential biodiversity hot spots. Previous research has shown that large-scale geomorphic variables can be linked to fish habitat use and used as predictors of fish species occurrence. Our goal was to determine whether reliable models of species distributions could be developed for freshwater fish in British Columbia, using large-scale macrohabitat data linkable to GIS (geographic information system) map coverages. We surveyed 48 streams in a representative watershed with high species diversity (the Blackwater) and developed statistical models based on macrohabitat variables to predict the distribution of 15 fish species found within the drainage. Correct classification rates of our logistic regression models based solely on map-based variables were generally high for most species found in the Blackwater (ranging from 73\% to 90\%) and showed only marginal improvement with inclusion of field-based information. The models correctly predicted the presence of individual species at stream sites 82.2\% of the time (on average) when applied to an independent data set from the Blackwater drainage, but were much less successful when applied to data from a geographically distant watershed (the Similkameen). Further refinements to quantify interregional variation in habitat conditions, however, should allow the development of regional fish distribution models as a GIS layer in British Columbia's new watershed atlas.},

Culverts permitted as no-slope (one of the most common design types) or as an unknown design type were barriers in 45\% of cases.

Such lack of historical information can underestimate the magnitude of decline for depressed populations. We applied genetic tools to a unique collection of 100-year-old salmon scales to reveal declines of 56\%--99\% in wild sockeye populations across Canada's second largest salmon watershed, the Skeena River. These analyses reveal century-long declines that are much greater than those based on modern era abundance data, which suggested that only 7 of 13 populations declined over the last five decades. Populations of larger-bodied fish have declined the most in abundance, likely because of size-selective commercial fisheries. Our findings illustrate how a deep historical perspective can expand our understanding of past abundances to a time before species incurred significant losses from fishing, and help inform conservation for diminished populations.},

  abstract = {Wild juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) were individually marked in October 1990 and 1991 to evaluate the effects of habitat complexity and fish size on over-winter survival in Big Beef Creek, Washington. Habitat complexity was quantified for the habitat unit where the fish were collected and, in 1991, also for the 500-m reach downstream from the collection site. Survival, estimated from recovery of marked smolts at the stream's mouth, differed between years (25.4 and 46.2\%) and also varied among habitat units and reaches within years. Survival was at most weakly correlated with complexity of the habitat units but was strongly correlated with the quantity of woody debris and density of habitat units in the 500-m reach, and distance from the estuary. Because distance covaried with habitat complexity, we could not ascertain which factor had the primary influence on survival. In addition, larger fish generally survived at a higher rate than smaller individuals. However, fish tagged above William Symington Lake were smaller in the fall but larger as smolts and had higher survival rates than those tagged below the lake. Taken together, these results reveal complex relationships between size, habitat, and growth that may affect over-winter survival and subsequent life-history events.},

Stratigraphic analysis of fossil diatoms in 210Pbdated cores and inferences of past total phosphorus concentrations using diatom-based models were used to reconstruct the nutrient histories of Takysie, Tchesinkut, Francois, and Tyhee lakes. Diatom microfossils indicate that these lakes are probably naturally productive, but some nutrient enrichment has likely occurred in response to human development (since A.D. 1850), particularly in Tyhee Lake. However, in Tchesinkut and Francois lakes, some reduction in total phosphorus may have occurred in recent decades. Takysie, Tchesinkut, and Francois lakes have been dominated by planktonic diatoms indicative of high productivity (e.g., Stephanodiscus, Asterionella, Fragilaria crotonensis, Aulacoseira). Tyhee Lake has been dominated by benthic Fragilaria species, but Stephanodiscus minutulus has increased in recent decades. These data were pooled with previously published paleolimnological data from British Columbia to summarize cultural eutrophication patterns in this region. Out of 11 British Columbia lakes considered, 10 were productive before human intervention, but 7 eutrophied further as a result of human activities. One lake exhibited no obvious post-1850 change in diatom assemblage, suggesting little human impact on water quality. In three of the lakes, recent improvements in water quality may have occurred in response to recent mitigation efforts.},

  abstract = {We present a hierarchical Bayesian modelling (HBM) framework for estimating riverine fish population size from successive removal data via electrofishing. It is applied to the estimation of the population of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) juveniles in the Oir River (France). The data set consists of 10 sampling sites sampled by one or two removals over a period of 20 years (1986--2005). We develop and contrast four models to assess the effect of temporal variations and habitat type on the density of fish and the probability of capture. The Bayes factor and the deviance information criterion are used to compare these models. The most credible and parsimonious model is the one that accounts for the effects of the years and the habitat type on the density of fish. It is used to extrapolate the population size in the entire river reach. This paper illustrates that HBM successfully accommodates large but sparse data sets containing poorly informative data for some units. Its conditional structure enables it to borrow strength from data-rich to data-poor units, thus improving the estimations. Predictions of the population size of the entire river reach can be derived, while accounting for all sources of uncertainty.},

Both cutthroat and coho occurred at their highest densities in very small streams ({$<$} 5 m channel width), and bankfull channel width was the single best predictor of cutthroat presence (p = 0.0001) and density (R 2 = 0.55). Within a channel, densities of coho and larger (yearling and older) cutthroat parr were highest in pools, while densities of young-of-the-year cutthroat were significantly lower in pools and highest in shallower habitats. Abundance of larger cutthroat parr and pool habitat were positively correlated with large woody debris (LWD) within a subset of intermediate-gradient gravel--cobble streams, where pools appear to be limiting to larger cutthroat parr abundance. More than 50\% of pools were formed by scour associated with LWD in streams ranging from 1.2 to 11 m channel width, and pools formed by LWD scour were on average 10\% deeper than pools formed by other mechanisms. Disproportionate use of small streams by cutthroat indicates that protection of small stream habitat is important for long-term conservation of sea-run populations.},

  abstract = {Two decades since calls for stream restoration projects to be scientifically assessed, most projects are still unevaluated, and conducted evaluations yield ambiguous results. Even after these decades of investigation, do we know how to define and measure success? We systematically reviewed 26 studies of stream restoration projects that used macroinvertebrate indicators to assess the success of habitat heterogeneity restoration projects. All 26 studies were previously included in two meta-analyses that sought to assess whether restoration programs were succeeding. By contrast, our review focuses on the evaluations themselves, and asks what exactly we are measuring and learning from these evaluations. All 26 studies used taxonomic diversity, richness, or abundance of invertebrates as biological measures of success, but none presented explicit arguments why those metrics were relevant measures of success for the restoration projects. Although changes in biodiversity may reflect overall ecological condition at the regional or global scale, in the context of reach-scale habitat restoration, more abundance and diversity may not necessarily be better. While all 26 studies sought to evaluate the biotic response to habitat heterogeneity enhancement projects, about half of the studies (46\%) explicitly measured habitat alteration, and 31\% used visual estimates of grain size or subjectively judged `habitat quality' from protocols ill-suited for the purpose. Although the goal of all 26 projects was to increase habitat heterogeneity, 31\% of the studies either sampled only riffles or did not specify the habitats sampled. One-third of the studies (35\%) used reference ecosystems to define target conditions. After 20 years of stream restoration evaluation, more work remains for the restoration community to identify appropriate measures of success and to coordinate monitoring so that evaluations are at a scale capable of detecting ecosystem change.},

  abstract = {As climate change intensifies, there is increasing interest in developing models that reduce uncertainties in projections of global climate and refine these projections to finer spatial scales. Forecasts of climate impacts on ecosystems are far more challenging and their uncertainties even larger because of a limited understanding of physical controls on biological systems. Management and conservation plans that explicitly account for changing climate are rare and even those generally rely on retrospective analyses rather than future scenarios of climatic conditions and associated responses of specific ecosystems. Using past biophysical relationships as a guide to predicting the impacts of future climate change assumes that the observed relationships will remain constant. However, this assumption involves a long chain of uncertainty about future greenhouse gas emissions, climate sensitivity to changes in greenhouse gases, and the ecological consequences of climate change. These uncertainties in forecasting biological responses to changing climate highlight the need for resource management and conservation policies that are robust to unknowns and responsive to change. We suggest how policy might develop despite substantial uncertainties about the future state of salmon ecosystems.},

  abstract = {I studied the seasonal movements and habitat use of fluvial westslope cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarki lewisi from 1997 to 1999 in the Blackfoot River drainage in western Montana to help guide restoration efforts and lead to a better understanding of this subspecies. Of 22 radio-tagged fish, 16 migrated during the spawning period (mean length, 371 mm). Ten of the 22 fish were tracked over a 2-year period, and 2 of these fish migrated in both 1997 and 1998. Migrations to tributaries occurred during the rising limb of the hydrograph in both years and lasted for an average of 10 d (range, 1-14 d) in 1998. Migratory fish moved both upriver and downriver to reach spawning tributaries during both years. In 1998 the mean distance traveled to access tributaries was 31 km (range, 3-72 km). Fish staged at the mouths of tributaries for up to 14 d before entering near the peak in the hydrograph. They remained in tributaries for an average of 27 d (range, 4-63 d), the duration varying with size of tributary and flow year. Once in tributaries, fish generally remained within a 200-m reach, but frequently moved within the area. In four tributaries to the Blackfoot River, actively spawning fish were observed in May 1998 as flows subsided after the peak discharge. Neither of the two repeat migrants spawned within 3 km of their previous year's spawning location, though both spawned in the same tributaries. After leaving tributaries, fish moved both up- and downriver to overwintering areas and did not move more than 100 m thereafter. Fish did not exhibit fidelity to their prespawning main-stem locations. At least six fish died after spawning (38\%). Westslope cutthroat trout movements, prespawning and postspawning, exhibited a plasticity not previously reported in Montana and demonstrate the large spatial extent to which fluvial westslope cutthroat trout utilize aquatic resources. To enable continued improvement of the westslope cutthroat trout population in the Blackfoot River drainage, I recommend riparian timber management that continues long-term input of large woody debris to tributaries, continued closure of the Blackfoot River watershed to angling harvest, and the use of culvert designs that will pass spawning fish under most flow conditions.},

Batch marks can be readily applied, but individual animal movements cannot be identified. We describe a method to estimate population size in a stratified population when movement takes place among strata and animals are marked with a combination of batch and individually identifiable tags. A hierarchical model with Bayesian inference is developed that pools information across segments on the detection efficiency based on radio-tagged fish and also uses the movement of the radio-tagged fish to impute the movement of the batch-marked fish to provide estimates of the population size on a segment and river level. The batch marks provide important information to help estimate the movement rates, but contribute little to the overall estimate of the population size. In this case, the approximate equal catchability among strata in either sample obviates the need for stratification.},

We used the acclimated chronic exposure (ACE) method to assess the upper thermal limits and growth optima of bull trout fed daily to satiation over test temperatures ranging from 8{\cyrchar\CYRNJE}C to 28{\cyrchar\CYRNJE}C during 60-d trials. Survival of age-0 bull trout was at least 98\% at 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18{\cyrchar\CYRNJE}C, but 0\% at 22, 24, 26, and 28{\cyrchar\CYRNJE}C after 60 d. The predicted ultimate upper incipient lethal temperature for these trout was 20.9{\cyrchar\CYRNJE}C. Peak growth, as estimated by regression analysis, occurred at 13.2{\cyrchar\CYRNJE}C (95\% confidence interval, 10.9--15.4{\cyrchar\CYRNJE}C). Feed consumption declined significantly (P Ͻ 0.001) at temperatures greater than 16{\cyrchar\CYRNJE}C, and fish held at temperatures of 22{\cyrchar\CYRNJE}C and above did not feed. Feed, lipid, and protein efficiencies were similar at 8--18{\cyrchar\CYRNJE}C but declined significantly (P Ͻ 0.001) at 20{\cyrchar\CYRNJE}C. Our results corroborate field investigations suggesting that bull trout have among the lowest upper thermal limits and growth optima of North American salmonids. The slower acclimation times and long-term duration of the ACE method resulted in a more realistic measure of thermal tolerance in natural situations than would have been obtained with traditional methods and afforded sufficient time for sublethal differences in growth rate, feed consumption, and feed efficiency to become apparent.},

  abstract = {Executive Summary The Pacific Northwest Aquatic Monitoring Partnership (PNAMP) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries Service hosted a workshop in Portland, Oregon, November 19--20, 2008, on Intrinsic Potential (IP) analyses. The purpose of the workshop was to improve the state of the knowledge and consistency of IP analyses and methodologies for anadromous and resident salmonids in the Pacific Northwest and California. This is a summary report from that workshop; it contains background reference material compiled in advance of the workshop, summaries of the sessions held, contributions from participants, and a synthesis of this input in the form of guidelines for conducting IP analyses. This report is intended to provide general guidance and scientific and technical perspectives for reach-based habitat potential analyses. The first day was devoted to discussion of the development and maintenance of spatial datasets. The second day was devoted to biological considerations of IP models. Sixty-two participants attended the workshop, from six Federal agencies, two State agencies, three Tribal entities, six nongovernmental organizations, and seven private firms. Prior to the workshop, approximately 15 individuals provided information about their research relevant to IP analyses; some of this information is summarized and synthesized in this report. The workshop resulted in an increase in regional knowledge, awareness, and input on this new paradigm for describing habitat potential for aquatic organisms. It brought together scientists, GIS analysts, and resource managers to facilitate a greater understanding of the importance of data quality, scale, sources, and gaps in the context of designing biological models. Specifically, spatial analysts and biologists gained perspective on both the accuracy and precision of hydrogeomorphic variables and the accuracy and precision of species-specific preference curves and thresholds based on the same variables. Workshop accomplishments include the following: {$\bullet$} Improved state of the knowledge and consistency of approach for IP analyses on anadromous and resident salmonids in the Pacific Northwest (Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and northern California); {$\bullet$} Enhanced working relationships among State,Tribal, private and Federal fisheries biologists, spatial analysts, and resource managers who develop IP-type models or utilize their results; {$\bullet$} Shared IP-related habitat data and species preference curves; and {$\bullet$} Gained consensus on the need for coordination regarding IP-related research and application. This report is a summary of the workshop proceedings, input received in advance of the workshop, and expert opinion of the workshop leaders. It is not a traditional workshop summary. Our goal for this report is to provide the reader with background information (much of it refereed), general guidance and common perspectives (from attendees), an overall synthesis, and suggested guidelines from the authors and their combined expertise in IP analyses. There was a large volume of information offered and referenced by participants in advance of and during the workshop; this report is our attempt to share that information in an outlet that can be referenced in the future. The report emphasizes the current state of knowledge and use of IP models; however, we also attempted to capture discussion about needs for development of additional tools, resources, and guidelines. These perspectives will be incorporated into upcoming peer-reviewed manuscripts that will include a guidance framework to help researchers develop IP models.}

  abstract = {Large portions of watersheds and streams are lost to anadromous fishes because of anthropogenic barriers to migration. The loss of these streams and rivers has shifted the distribution of accessible habitat, often reducing the diversity of accessible habitat and the quantity of high-quality habitat. We combined existing inventories of barriers to adult fish passage in the Willamette and Lower Columbia River basins and identified 1,491 anthropogenic barriers to fish passage blocking 14,931 km of streams. We quantified and compared the stream quality, land cover, and physical characteristics of lost versus currently accessible habitat by watershed, assessed the effect of barriers on the variability of accessible habitats, and investigated potential impacts of habitat reduction on endangered or threatened salmonid populations. The majority of the study watersheds have lost more than 40\% of total fish stream habitat. Overall, 40\% of the streams with spawning gradients suitable for steelhead (anadromous rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss), 60\% of streams with riparian habitat in good condition, and 30\% of streams draining watersheds with all coniferous land cover are no longer accessible to anadromous fish. Across watersheds, hydrologic and topographic watershed characteristics were correlated with barrier location, barrier density, and the impacts of barriers on habitat. Population-based abundance scores for spring Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha were strongly correlated with the magnitude of habitat lost and the number of lowland fish passage barriers. The characteristics of barrier and habitat distribution presented in this paper indicate that barrier removal projects and mitigation for instream barriers should consider both the magnitude and quality of the lost habitat.},

More recently, climate change is steadily increasing stress on aging traditional, gray infra\- structure. Recent trends in river management present an opportunity to address both the ecological degradation and climate stress. A strategic focus on riverscapes as critical natural infrastructure can serve as ecosystem-based adaptation to improve resilience to climate change and restore river ecosystem health. As traditional, gray infrastructure ages and fails under increasing climate stress, there is opportunity to rebuild with improved un\- derstanding of the value of the ecosystem services that healthy riverscapes provide. River valley bottoms, including source-water wetlands and riverscape floodplains, are the critical natural infrastructure areas deserving of protection and restoration to build resilience to increased frequency and severity of fires, floods and droughts associated with climate change. Since healthy riverscapes need space and water, the long-standing focus on restoring natural flow regimes makes sense. Equally crucial to restoring river health is to give rivers space and freedom to exercise (i.e., flood and adjust their channels).},

  abstract = {In rivers supporting Pacific salmon in southeast Alaska, USA, regional trends toward a warmer, wetter climate are predicted to increase mid- and late-21st-century mean annual flood size by 17\% and 28\%, respectively. Increased flood size could alter stream habitats used by Pacific salmon for reproduction, with negative consequences for the substantial economic, cultural, and ecosystem services these fish provide. We combined field measurements and model simulations to estimate the potential influence of future flood disturbance on geomorphic processes controlling the quality and extent of coho, chum, and pink salmon spawning habitat in over 800 southeast Alaska watersheds. Spawning habitat responses varied widely across watersheds and among salmon species. Little variation among watersheds in potential spawning habitat change was explained by predicted increases in mean annual flood size. Watershed response diversity was mediated primarily by topographic controls on stream channel confinement, reach-scale geomorphic associations with spawning habitat preferences, and complexity in the pace and mode of geomorphic channel responses to altered flood size. Potential spawning habitat loss was highest for coho salmon, which spawn over a wide range of geomorphic settings, including steeper, confined stream reaches that are more susceptible to streambed scour during high flows. We estimated that 9--10\% and 13--16\% of the spawning habitat for coho salmon could be lost by the 2040s and 2080s, respectively, with losses occurring primarily in confined, higher-gradient streams that provide only moderate-quality habitat. Estimated effects were lower for pink and chum salmon, which primarily spawn in unconfined floodplain streams. Our results illustrate the importance of accounting for valley and reach-scale geomorphic features in watershed assessments of climate vulnerability, especially in topographically complex regions. Failure to consider the geomorphic context of stream networks will hamper efforts to understand and mitigate the vulnerability of anadromous fish habitat to climate-induced hydrologic change.},

  abstract = {Much effort has been devoted to developing, constructing and refining fish passage facilities to enable target species to pass barriers on fluvial systems, and yet, fishway science, engineering and practice remain imperfect. In this review, 17 experts from different fish passage research fields (i.e., biology, ecology, physiology, ecohydraulics, engineering) and from different continents (i.e., North and South America, Europe, Africa, Australia) identified knowledge gaps and provided a roadmap for research priorities and technical developments. Once dominated by an engineering-focused approach, fishway science today involves a wide range of disciplines from fish behaviour to socioeconomics to complex modelling of passage prioritization options in river networks. River barrier impacts on fish migration and dispersal are currently better understood than historically, but basic ecological knowledge underpinning the need for effective fish passage in many regions of the world, including in biodiversity hotspots (e.g., equatorial Africa, South-East Asia), remains largely unknown. Designing efficient fishways, with minimal passage delay and post-passage impacts, requires adaptive management and continued innovation. While the use of fishways in river restoration demands a transition towards fish passage at the community scale, advances in selective fishways are also needed to manage invasive fish colonization. Because of the erroneous view in some literature and communities of practice that fish passage is largely a proven technology, improved international collaboration, information sharing, method standardization and multidisciplinary training are needed. Further development of regional expertise is needed in South America, Asia and Africa where hydropower dams are currently being planned and constructed.},

  abstract = {The habitat requirements of fish in streams are in many ways similar to those of humans in our own environment. Fish need a place to live and reproduce, oxygen, tolerable temperatures, food, and clean water free of excess sediment or pollutants. The existence of good fish habitat is dependent on a number of factors, such as geology , climate, water flow, the absence of barriers to upstream or downstream movement, habitat structure (pools, riffles, shelter), water quality, the presence of sufficient food, and the lack of excessive numbers of predators and competitors. This publication provides information on how these factors affect fish, with particular attention given to anadromous salmonids. Salmonids are fish in the taxonomic family Salmonidae, including the many species of salmon and trout (Moyle and Cech 2000). Salmonids present in California include Chinook, coho, chum, pink, and kokanee salmon, steel-head, char, rainbow trout, brook trout, and brown trout. Anadromous refers to fish that are born in fresh water, migrate to the sea where they grow and mature, and then return to fresh water to spawn.},

  abstract = {The established position and increasing availability of Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) as an important source of information including forest inventory, allows additional applications to be developed when such data are already available. One key focus area for the application of ALS data is the assessment of riparian ecosystems, due to their critical role for providing, regulating and supporting important ecosystem services. ALS data provide detailed and accurate digital terrain models (DTMs) under forest canopy, which in turn enable the characterization of detailed stream networks, stream properties, and associated vegetation characteristics in adjacent riparian ecotones. In a complex Pacific Northwest coastal forest, we demonstrate how ALS point clouds can be used to map a stream network and characterize stream properties including stream order, width, gradient, sinuosity, and solar shading. Of relevance to regulatory and sustainability related elements of forest management, we demonstrate the use of these data to identify stream classes and related riparian zones, as well as the fish-bearing potential of the stream. The total length of identified streams was 6421.8 km, of which 55\% were of the lowest order streams. The median stream gradient was 16.4\% with median stream width varying between 0.58 and 19.67 m for the smallest to largest streams respectively. Stream class and fish bearing potential were evaluated using independent data, with overall accuracies of 61.0\% for stream class and 82.9\% for fish-bearing potential. The median of stand height, canopy cover, and stand vertical variability within riparian management areas was 19.8 m, 88.6\%, and 68\%, respectively, and in general did not vary across stream orders. The majority of streams (74.4\%) were not accessible for anadromous fish. For fish-bearing streams, we found that only 0.2\% had a mean stand height b 2 m, while 2.4\% had canopy cover of b 20\%, and only 7.3\% received b10 h of shade. The ALS data thus enabled a holistic characterization of riparian ecotones, providing useful information on both stream and vegetation properties that can support sustainable forest management, inform on erosion risk, and become a foundation for the quantification of ecosystem goods and services.},

  abstract = {Recent droughts raise global concern over potential biodiversity loss and mitigating impacts to vulnerable species has become a management priority. However, drought impacts on populations are difficult to predict, in part, because habitat refuges can buffer organisms from harsh environmental conditions. In a global change context, more extreme droughts may turn previously suitable habitats into ecological traps, where vulnerable species can no longer persist. Here, we explore the impacts of California's recent record-breaking drought on endangered juvenile Coho salmon. We estimated the variability of cumulative salmon survival using mark--recapture of nearly 20,000 tagged fish in intermittent stream pools during a 7-year period encompassing drought and non-drought conditions. We then determined the relative importance of physical habitat, streamflow, precipitation, landscape, and biological characteristics that may limit survival during drought. Our most striking result was an increase in the number of pools with reduced or zero survival during drought years and a coincident increase in spatial variability in survival among study reaches. In nearly half of the stream pools, salmon survival during drought was similar to mean survival of pools assessed during non-drought years, indicating some pools had remarkable resistance (ability to withstand disturbance) to extreme drought. Lower survival was most attributable to longer duration of disconnection between upstream and downstream habitats, a consequence of increasing drought severity. Our results not only suggest that many pools sustain juvenile salmon in non-drought years transition into ecological traps during drought but also highlight that some pools serve as refuges even under extreme drought conditions. Projected increases in drought severity that lead to longer droughts and greater habitat fragmentation could transform an increasing proportion of suitable habitats into ecological traps. Predicting future impacts of drought on Coho salmon and other sensitive species will require identification and protection of drought refuges and management strategies that prevent further habitat fragmentation.},

  abstract = {In this study, we assessed the restoration of a riparian wetland in a moderately incised glacial till valley of the Midwest where drainage pipes were either removed or disabled in 2000 and 2004. The study determined whether wetland hydrology was restored at the site and whether former drainage pipe locations still influenced wetland hydrology after restoration ended. Water table level measurements in 2004 and 2005 indicate that wetland hydrology has been restored in areas of the riparian zone with poorly drained loamy soil. These areas are characterized by an average water table depth of 10 cm below ground surface (BGS) for approximately six months of the year and a water level above 30 cm BGS for at least 14 consecutive days during the growing season. High-resolution water table measurements during and after precipitation events did not indicate that former drainage pipe locations affect the hydrology of the site either by allowing a quick water table drawdown or by acting as preferential conduits for groundwater during precipitation events. Overall, data indicate that wetland hydrology was restored and that the technique of cutting the drainage pipes into several sections or removing them by hand and compacting the disturbed soil back into place without adding any extra material was an appropriate restoration technique for this site.}

  abstract = {Gravel-bedded streams are thought to have a characteristic meandering form bordered by a self-formed, fine-grained floodplain. This ideal guides a multibillion-dollar stream restoration industry. We have mapped and dated many of the deposits along mid-Atlantic streams that formed the basis for this widely accepted model. These data, as well as historical maps and records, show instead that before European settlement, the streams were small anabranching channels within extensive vegetated wetlands that accumulated little sediment but stored substantial organic carbon. Subsequently, 1 to 5 meters of slackwater sedimentation, behind tens of thousands of 17th- to 19th-century milldams, buried the presettlement wetlands with fine sediment. These findings show that most floodplains along mid-Atlantic streams are actually fill terraces, and historically incised channels are not natural archetypes for meandering streams.},

  abstract = {Climate change and human activities are transforming river flows globally, with potentially large consequences for freshwater life. To help inform watershed and flow management, there is a need for empirical studies linking flows and fish productivity. We tested the effects of river conditions and other factors on 22 years of Chinook salmon productivity in a watershed in British Columbia, Canada. Freshwater conditions during adult salmon migration and spawning, as well as during juvenile rearing, explained a large amount of variation in productivity. August river flows while salmon fry reared had the strongest effect on productivity---our model predicted that cohorts that experience 50\% below average flow in the August of rearing have 21\% lower productivity. These contemporary relationships are set within long-term changes in climate, land use, and hydrology. Over the last century, average August river discharge decreased by 26\%, air temperatures warmed, and water withdrawals increased. Seventeen percent of the watershed was logged in the last 20 years. Our results suggest that, in order to remain stable, this Chinook salmon population being assessed for legal protection requires substantially higher August flow than previously recommended. Changing flow regimes---driven by watershed impacts and climate change---can threaten imperilled fish populations.},

Restoration based on the engineering activities of beavers (Castor canadensis) increases fish habitat complexity, but how this affects fish habitat use and movement behaviours is not well known. We used a network of passive integrated transponder antennas to quantify small-scale movement and microhabitat use of 175 individual juvenile steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in a stream channel with a complex bathymetric profile resulting from a beaver impoundment and in a simplified channel devoid of beaver activity. Our results show that juvenile steelhead exploit microhabitat heterogeneity by employing a range of behaviours that maximizes available habitat via spatial and temporal partitioning among individuals. These results suggest spatial resource partitioning as a potential mechanism for the previously established positive correlations among steelhead density, survival, and production with beaver-based restoration within the study watershed. More broadly, our findings provide insight as to how populations can exploit habitat complexity through spatial partitioning that can be informative for planning restoration and management actions.},

  abstract = {Beaver are an integral component of hydrologic, geomorphic, and biotic processes within North American stream systems, and their propensity to build dams alters stream and riparian structure and function to the benefit of many aquatic and terrestrial species. Recognizing this, beaver relocation efforts and/or application of structures designed to mimic the function of beaver dams are increasingly being utilized as effective and cost-efficient stream and riparian restoration approaches. Despite these verities, the notion that beaver dams negatively impact stream habitat remains common, specifically the assumption that beaver dams increase stream temperatures during summer to the detriment of sensitive biota such as salmonids. In this study, we tracked beaver dam distributions and monitored water temperature throughout 34 km of stream for an eight-year period between 2007 and 2014. During this time the number of natural beaver dams within the study area increased by an order of magnitude, and an additional 4 km of stream were subject to a restoration manipulation that included installing a high-density of Beaver Dam Analog (BDA) structures designed to mimic the function of natural beaver dams. Our observations reveal several mechanisms by which beaver dam development may influence stream temperature regimes; including longitudinal buffering of diel summer temperature extrema at the reach scale due to increased surface water storage, and creation of cool---water channel scale temperature refugia through enhanced groundwater---surface water connectivity. Our results suggest that creation of natural and/or artificial beaver dams could be used to mitigate the impact of human induced thermal degradation that may threaten sensitive species.},

While the concept of process-based restoration in riverscapes has been advocated for at least two decades, details and specific examples on how to implement it remain sparse. Here, we describe `low-tech process-based restoration' (LT-PBR) as a practice of using simple, low unit-cost, structural additions (e.g. wood and beaver dams) to riverscapes to mimic functions and initiate specific processes. Hallmarks of this approach include: - An explicit focus on the processes that a low-tech restoration intervention is meant to promote - A conscious effort to use cost-effective, low-tech treatments (e.g. hand-built, natural materials, non-engineered, short-term design life-spans) because of the need to efficiently scale-up application. - `Letting the system do the work' which defers critical decision making to riverscapes and nature's ecosystem engineers.

These habitats span lengths of entire river systems, crossing international borders and management jurisdictions, while encompassing a range of climate and landscape conditions and human impacts. We developed the Riverscape Analysis Project (RAP) to provide a consistent and comprehensive geospatial database to document, assess, and compare the physical habitats of large salmon rivers of the North Pacific Rim (NPR). Here, we introduce and summarize a web-based GIS and decision support system (DSS) to assist salmon conservation around the NPR. The foundation of the RAP database is a seamless mosaic of moderate (30 m) resolution, multispectral satellite imagery from the Landsat TM instrument series, mapped with coincident 90-m resolution digital terrain Digital Evaluation Model (DEM) information to a consistent global projection; these data produced a set of watershed, river, and floodplain physical features and derived riverine freshwater habitat metrics important for salmon. The RAP DSS is publicly available online (http://rap.ntsg.umt.edu) and includes user-friendly tools and tutorials to allow users to compare, query, and download geospatial summary data across a suite of physical metrics.}

In our study of a coastal Oregon watershed, we found that intermittent streams were an important source of coho salmon smolts. Residual pools in intermittent streams provided a means by which juvenile coho could survive during dry periods; smolts that overwintered in intermittent streams were larger than those from perennial streams. Movement of juvenile coho into intermittent tributaries from the mainstem was another way in which the fish exploited the habitat and illustrates the importance of maintaining accessibility for entire stream networks. Loss of intermittent stream habitat would have a negative effect on coho salmon populations in coastal drainages, including downstream navigable waters.},

In our study of a coastal Oregon watershed, we found that intermittent streams were an important source of coho salmon smolts. Residual pools in intermittent streams provided a means by which juvenile coho could survive during dry periods; smolts that overwintered in intermittent streams were larger than those from perennial streams. Movement of juvenile coho into intermittent tributaries from the mainstem was another way in which the fish exploited the habitat and illustrates the importance of maintaining accessibility for entire stream networks. Loss of intermittent stream habitat would have a negative effect on coho salmon populations in coastal drainages, including downstream navigable waters.},

  abstract = {Intermittent streams lose surface flow during part of the year but can provide important habitat for imperiled fishes in residual pools. However, extended intermittency can drive high mortality as pool contraction decreases pool quality, and some pools dry completely. We evaluated the influence of a suite of abiotic habitat characteristics on the over-summer survival of two imperiled salmonid fishes (coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch; steelhead trout Oncorhynchus mykiss) at four study sites on two tributaries of Salmon Creek (Sonoma County, California, USA) from 2012 to 2014, during deepening drought conditions. Study sites spanned an intermittency gradient from continuous flow to near-dry conditions, and included alluvial and bedrock stream reaches. We estimated over-summer survival at the pool scale from fish presence--absence data based on paired early-late summer snorkel surveys. We measured pool dimensions and water quality parameters monthly (more frequently during summer dry down) and, in 2013 and 2014, recorded water quality with continuous loggers in selected pools. We performed: (1) logistic regression in a generalized linear modeling framework to identify factors limiting over-summer survival and (2) classification trees using the random forests ensemble learning method to identify abiotic thresholds for sustaining salmonids. Results suggested that different factors governed mortality of the two species. Coho salmon, which tended to survive in large, deep pools, were limited by minimum dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations. In contrast, steelhead trout, which tended to survive in pools with large surface area, were sensitive to pool geometry and temperature. Both species persisted for weeks in large pools with low DO levels, including in pools where at least part of the water column reached sublethal or lethal levels. Our results suggest that shallow, lateral hyporheic flow may be important for maintaining DO and temperatures suitable for sustaining salmonids in isolated pools, whereas groundwater discharge originating from deeper flow paths may generate low-DO conditions that inhibit salmonid persistence. Geomorphically complex watersheds with a variety of pool geometries and high rates of lateral hyporheic exchange are those most likely to serve as ``sanctuary reaches'' for imperiled Pacific salmonid populations in semi-arid regions in the context of a changing climate.},

  abstract = {River-wetland corridors form where a high degree of connectivity between the surface (rheic) and subsurface (hyporheic) components of streamflow creates an interconnected system of channels, wetlands, ponds, and lakes. River-wetland corridors occur where the valley floor is sufficiently wide to accommodate a laterally unconfined river planform that may feature morphologically complex, multi-threaded channels with vegetated bars, islands, and floodplains. River-wetland corridors can develop anywhere there is valley expansion along a drainage network, from the headwaters to estuaries or deltas, and they are found across all latitudes and within all biomes and hydroclimates. River-wetland corridors may be longitudinally continuous but are commonly interspersed with singlethread reaches in narrower portions of the valley. The development and persistence of river-wetland corridors is driven by combinations of geologic, biotic, and geomorphic processes that create a river environment that is diverse, heterogeneous, patchy, and dynamically stable, and within which patterns of flow, sediment features, and habitats shift continually. Hence, we describe these polydimensional river corridors as ``kaleidoscope rivers.'' Historically, river-wetland corridors were pervasive in wide, alluvial valley reaches, but their presence has been so diminished worldwide (due to a diverse range of anthropogenic activities and impacts) that the general public and even most river managers are unaware of their former pervasiveness. Here, we define river-wetland corridors as a river type; review paleoenvironmental and historical records to establish their past ubiquity; describe the geologic, biotic, and geomorphic processes responsible for their formation and persistence; and provide examples of river-wetland corridor remnants that still survive. We close by highlighting the significance of the diverse river functions supported by river-wetland corridors, the consequences of diminution and neglect of this river type, and the implications for river restoration.},

  abstract = {A hierarchical model is described for estimating population size from single- and multiple-pass removal sampling. The model is appropriate for two-stage sampling schemes, typified by surveys of riverine fish populations, in which multiple sites are surveyed, but a low number of passes are undertaken at each site. The model estimates the average population size within the target area from the raw catch data, and thus allows for differences in the sampling procedure at each site, such as including single-pass sampling. The model also uses the data from all sites to estimate the population size at each individual site. This results in generally improved precision for multiple-pass sites and provides comparable estimates from single-pass sites. A Bayesian approach is described for estimating the parameters of the hierarchical model using sampling importance resampling (SIR). An empirical Bayesian approach, which ignores prior uncertainty but is simpler to implement, is also described. Application of the hierarchical model is illustrated with electrofishing data for 0+ trout (Salmo trutta) in the River Inny, U.K.},

  abstract = {It is now widely recognized that climate change affects multiple sectors in virtually every part of the world. Impacts on one sector may influence other sectors, including seemingly remote ones, which we call ``interconnections of climate risks.'' While a substantial number of climate risks are identified in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report, there have been few attempts to explore the interconnections between them in a comprehensive way. To fill this gap, we developed a methodology for visualizing climate risks and their interconnections based on a literature survey. Our visualizations highlight the need to address climate risk interconnections in impact and vulnerability studies. Our risk maps and flowcharts show how changes in climate impact natural and socioeconomic systems, ultimately affecting human security, health, and well-being. We tested our visualization approach with potential users and identified likely benefits and issues. Our methodology can be used as a communication tool to inform decision makers, stakeholders, and the general public of the cascading risks that can be triggered by climate change. Plain Language Summary The paper demonstrates in a most holistic manner how climate change can generate various risks and how they are actually interconnected. Based on a literature survey using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report, we identified 91 climate risks and 253 causal relationships among them and graphically drew such interconnected risks. We found that changes in the climate system impact the natural and socioeconomic system, influencing ultimately human security, health, and well-being. This indicates that climate change can trigger a cascade of impacts across sectors. Our findings point to the need to address the climate risk interconnections in impact and vulnerability studies. We tested our visualization approach with potential users and identified likely benefits and issues. The implications of our study go beyond science. Our study is useful to inform stakeholders of a broad yet fresh perspective of climate risks that have not been presented before.},

We used a combination of mitochondrial and nuclear molecular methods to identify potential units of conservation of Westslope Cutthroat Trout Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi, a taxon native to montane river basins of the northwestern United States and southwestern Canada. Mitogenomic sequencing identified two major lineages composed of nine monophyletic clades, and a well-supported subclade within one of these, largely delineated by river basins. Analyses of microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms corroborated most of these groupings, sometimes with less resolution but demonstrating more complex connections among clades. The mitochondrial and nuclear analyses revealed that Pleistocene glacial cycles profoundly influenced the distribution and divergence of Westslope Cutthroat Trout, that this taxon crossed the Continental Divide in two separate events, and that genetically pure but nonindigenous fish were widely distributed. Herein, we recognize nine geographically discrete, cytonuclear lineages largely circumscribed by major river basins as potential units of conservation: (1) John Day; (2) Coeur d'Alene; (3) St. Joe; (4) North Fork Clearwater; (5) Salmon; (6) Clearwater headwaters; (7) Clearwater--eastern Cascades; (8) neoboreal, consisting of most of the Columbia upstream from central Washington, the Fraser in British Columbia, and the South Saskatchewan in Alberta; and (9) Missouri.},
