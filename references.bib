  abstract = {Process-based restoration aims to reestablish normative rates and magnitudes of physical, chemical, and biological processes that sustain river and floodplain ecosystems. Ecosystem conditions at any site are governed by hierarchical regional, watershed, and reach-scale processes controlling hydrologic and sediment regimes; floodplain and aquatic habitat dynamics; and riparian and aquatic biota. We outline and illustrate four process-based principles that ensure river restoration will be guided toward sustainable actions: (1) restoration actions should address the root causes of degradation, (2) actions must be consistent with the physical and biological potential of the site, (3) actions should be at a scale commensurate with environmental problems, and (4) actions should have clearly articulated expected outcomes for ecosystem dynamics. Applying these principles will help avoid common pitfalls in river restoration, such as creating habitat types that are outside of a site's natural potential, attempting to build static habitats in dynamic environments, or constructing habitat features that are ultimately overwhelmed by unconsidered system drivers.},

  abstract = {Adult salmonids are frequently observed building redds adjacent to in-channel structure, including boulders and large woody debris. These areas are thought to be preferentially selected for a variety of reasons, including energy and/or predation refugia for spawners, and increased hyporheic exchange for incubating embryos. This research sought to quantify in-channel structure effects on local hydraulics and hyporheic flow and provide a mechanistic link between these changes and the survival, development, and growth of Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha embryos. Data were collected in an eight-kilometer reach, on the regulated lower Mokelumne River, in the California Central Valley. Nine paired sites, consisting of an area containing in-channel structure paired with an adjacent area lacking in-channel structure, were evaluated. Results indicated that in-channel structure disrupts surface water velocity patterns, creating pressure differences that significantly increase vertical hydraulic gradients within the subsurface. Overall, in-channel structure did not significantly increase survival, development, and growth of Chinook salmon embryos. However, at several low gradient downstream sites containing in-channel structure, embryo survival, development, and growth were significantly higher relative to paired sites lacking such features. Preliminary data indicate that adding or maintaining in-channel structure, including woody material, in suboptimal spawning reaches improves the incubation environment for salmonid embryos in regulated reaches of a lowland stream. More research examining temporal variation and a full range of incubation depths is needed to further assess these findings.},

  abstract = {Dam removal has been increasingly proposed as a river restoration technique, with several projects scheduled to occur in the western United States. In 2011, two large hydroelectric dams will be removed from the Elwha River on Washington State's Olympic Peninsula in one of the nation's largest dam removal projects. Ten anadromous fish populations are expected to recolonize {\textasciitilde}130 km of historical habitats after dam removal. A key to understanding watershed recolonization and ecosystem restoration is the collection of spatially continuous information on fish and aquatic habitats. To date, no studies have described spatially continuous fish and habitat relationships prior to dam removal, and consecutive-year studies throughout an entire river are rare. We conducted concurrent snorkel and habitat surveys in the Elwha River from the headwaters to the mouth (rkm 65 to 0) in 2007 and 2008. This ``riverscape'' approach was used to characterize spatial extent, assemblage structure, abundances, densities, and length classes of Pacific salmonids along a nearly continuous longitudinal gradient of 316 channel units. The longitudinal fish assemblage patterns revealed that species richness was highest below the dams, where anadromous salmonids still have access. The percent composition of salmonids was nearly identical in 2007 and 2008 for rainbow and cutthroat trout (89\%; 88\%), Chinook salmon (8\%; 9\%), and bull trout (3\% in both years). Pink salmon were observed ({$<$}1\%) in 2007 only. Spatial patterns of abundance for rainbow and cutthroat trout (Pearson's correlation, r = 0.76) and bull trout (r = 0.70) were consistent between years despite differences in river flows in 2007 and 2008. Both multivariate and univariate analyses revealed clear differences in habitat structure along the river profile, due to both natural and anthropogenic factors. The generated fish and habitat profiles helped to visualize fish and habitat relationships and revealed unexpected spatial variations in fish abundances. This comprehensive view helped to highlight species-specific biological hotspots, revealing that 60-69\% of federally threatened bull trout occurred near or below the dams. The riverscape approach also helped to focus future monitoring efforts, and addressed linkages between fish and aquatic habitats prior to dam removal. Spatially continuous surveys will be vital in evaluating the effectiveness of upcoming dam removal projects at restoring anadromous salmonids. These surveys are part of a larger effort to complete an atlas of riverscapes in major Olympic Peninsula rivers.},

  abstract = {The foundations of river restoration science rest comfortably in the fields of geology, hydrology, and engineering, and yet, the impetus for many, if not most, stream restoration projects is biological recovery. Although Lane's stream balance equation from the mid-1950s captured the dynamic equilibrium between the amount of stream flow, the slope of the channel, and the amount and calibre of sediment, it completely ignored biology. Similarly, most of the stream classification systems used in river restoration design today do not explicitly include biology as a primary driver of stream form and process. To address this omission, we cast biology as an equal partner with geology and hydrology, forming a triumvirate that governs stream morphology and evolution. To represent this, we have created the stream evolution triangle, a conceptual model that explicitly accounts for the influences of geology, hydrology, and biology. Recognition of biology as a driver leads to improved understanding of reach-scale morphology and the dynamic response mechanisms responsible for stream evolution and adjustment following natural or anthropogenic disturbance, including stream restoration. Our aim in creating the stream evolution triangle is not to exclude or supersede existing stream classifications and evolutionary models but to provide a broader ``thinking space'' within which they can be framed and reconsidered, thus facilitating thought outside of the alluvial box.},

Here, we tested that assertion by examining Fisheries Act authorizations to harmfully alter, disrupt, or destroy fish habitat issued by Fisheries and Oceans Canada during a 6-month period in 2012, obtained using access to information processes. We found the majority of projects (67\%) were authorized to impact more habitat than proponents were required to compensate for, likely resulting in a net loss of fish habitat. Our analysis show an aggregate net loss {\textemdash} defined as authorized impact minus required compensation {\textemdash} of 2\,919\,143 m               2               authorized across 78 projects.

Although stream ecologists know that river channel and floodplain habitats used by aquatic organisms are maintained by hydrologic regimes that mobilize gravel-bed sediments, terrestrial ecologists have largely been unaware of the importance of floodplain structures and processes to the life requirements of a wide variety of species. We provide insight into gravel-bed rivers as the ecological nexus of glaciated mountain landscapes. We show why gravel-bed river floodplains are the primary arena where interactions take place among aquatic, avian, and terrestrial species from microbes to grizzly bears and provide essential connectivity as corridors for movement for both aquatic and terrestrial species. Paradoxically, gravel-bed river floodplains are also disproportionately unprotected where human developments are concentrated. Structural modifications to floodplains such as roads, railways, and housing and hydrologic-altering hydroelectric or water storage dams have severe impacts to floodplain habitat diversity and productivity, restrict local and regional connectivity, and reduce the resilience of both aquatic and terrestrial species, including adaptation to climate change. To be effective, conservation efforts in glaciated mountain landscapes intended to benefit the widest variety of organisms need a paradigm shift that has gravel-bed rivers and their floodplains as the central focus and that prioritizes the maintenance or restoration of the intact structure and processes of these critically important systems throughout their length and breadth.},

  abstract = {Many studies have shown that macrophytes play a significant role in controlling eutrophication; however, only a few of these are based on macrophyte biomass. Based on the growth characteristic of macrophytes, we propose an approach for the assessment of the optimal biomass of macrophytes in the decay and growth periods in Lake Datong (a shallow lake), using a lake ecological model. The results showed that the pollution load of the lake should be reduced by 50\% while conforming to the Environmental Quality Standards for Surface Water (EQSSW) Class III. In contrast, with an increase in the pollution load of 5\%, the results indicate that the lake may deteriorate to a turbid state over the next few years. The macrophyte biomass should be harvested during the decay period, when 80\% biomass is beneficial to the water quality of the eutrophic shallow lake. Based on macrophyte simulation from 2020{\textendash}2024, the wet biomass of macrophytes should be controlled at 5.5 kg/m2. The current macrophyte biomass in Lake Datong is four-fold higher than the simulated optimal biomass. This study provides a reference for the adequate ecological restoration of the lake and its subsequent maintenance, as well as scientific support for improving the comprehensive evaluation standard of healthy lakes and the theoretical basis of lake ecological restoration.},

  abstract = {River management based solely on physical science has proven to be unsustainable and unsuccessful, evidenced by the fact that the problems this approach intended to solve (e.g., flood hazards, water scarcity, and channel instability) have not been solved and long-term deterioration in river environments has reduced the capacity of rivers to continue meeting the needs of society. In response, there has been a paradigm shift in management over the past few decades, towards river restoration. But the ecological, morphological, and societal benefits of river restoration have, on the whole, been disappointing. We believe that this stems from the fact that restoration overrelies on the same physical analyses and approaches, with flowing water still regarded as the universally predominant driver of channel form and structural intervention seen as essential to influencing fluvial processes. We argue that if river restoration is to reverse long-standing declines in river functions, it is necessary to recognize the influence of biology on river forms and processes and re-envisage what it means to restore a river. This entails shifting the focus of river restoration from designing and constructing stable channels that mimic natural forms to reconnecting streams within balanced and healthy biomes, and so levering the power of biology to influence river processes. We define this new approach as biomic river restoration.},

The development of the concept seems to follow two separate but simultaneous trajectories of increased popularity but also sustained critique. This paper offers an analysis of potential mechanisms behind these disparate trajectories by drawing on a theoretical framework from science and technology studies (STS) centred around "black box" and actor-network theory. To support our analysis, we perform an exploratory literature review of how the EBFM concept has been used in a selection of high impact fisheries research papers. We find that the popularity of EBFM does not guarantee its integrity, usefulness or analytical insight, but also that persistent critique of how the concept is used seems to be driving some change. We think that a continued trajectory of increased understanding, contextualization and discernibility of EBFM can help overcome the considerable ambiguity associated with the concept and make it increasingly useful to fisheries management. This means moving away from routine use of the term towards a practicable and tangible approach to improve fisheries sustainability.},

  abstract = {The construction of beaver dams facilitates a suite of hydrologic, hydraulic, geomorphic, and ecological feedbacks that increase stream complexity and channel{\textendash}floodplain connectivity that benefit aquatic and terrestrial biota. Depending on where beaver build dams within a drainage network, they impact lateral and longitudinal connectivity by introducing roughness elements that fundamentally change the timing, delivery, and storage of water, sediment, nutrients, and organic matter. While the local effects of beaver dams on streams are well understood, broader coverage network models that predict where beaver dams can be built and highlight their impacts on connectivity across diverse drainage networks are lacking. Here we present a capacity model to assess the limits of riverscapes to support dam-building activities by beaver across physiographically diverse landscapes. We estimated dam capacity with freely and nationally-available inputs to evaluate seven lines of evidence: (1) reliable water source, (2) riparian vegetation conducive to foraging and dam building, (3) vegetation within 100 m of edge of stream to support expansion of dam complexes and maintain large colonies, (4) likelihood that channel-spanning dams could be built during low flows, (5) the likelihood that a beaver dam is likely to withstand typical floods, (6) a suitable stream gradient that is neither too low to limit dam density nor too high to preclude the building or persistence of dams, and (7) a suitable river that is not too large to restrict dam building or persistence. Fuzzy inference systems were used to combine these controlling factors in a framework that explicitly also accounts for model uncertainty. The model was run for 40,561 km of streams in Utah, USA, and portions of surrounding states, predicting an overall network capacity of 356,294 dams at an average capacity of 8.8 dams/km. We validated model performance using 2852 observed dams across 1947 km of streams. The model showed excellent agreement with observed dam densities where beaver dams were present. Model performance was spatially coherent and logical, with electivity indices that effectively segregated capacity categories. That is, beaver dams were not found where the model predicted no dams could be supported, beaver avoided segments that were predicted to support rare or occasional densities, and beaver preferentially occupied and built dams in areas predicted to have pervasive dam densities. The resulting spatially explicit reach-scale (250 m long reaches) data identifies where dam-building activity is sustainable, and at what densities dams can occur across a landscape. As such, model outputs can be used to determine where channel{\textendash}floodplain and wetland connectivity are likely to persist or expand by promoting increases in beaver dam densities.},

Small streams differ widely in physical, chemical, and biotic attributes, thus providing habitats for a range of unique species. Headwater species include permanent residents as well as migrants that travel to headwaters at particular seasons or life stages. Movement by migrants links headwaters with downstream and terrestrial ecosystems, as do exports such as emerging and drifting insects. We review the diversity of taxa dependent on headwaters. Exemplifying this diversity are three unmapped headwaters that support over 290 taxa. Even intermittent streams may support rich and distinctive biological communities, in part because of the predictability of dry periods. The influence of headwaters on downstream systems emerges from their attributes that meet unique habitat requirements of residents and migrants by: offering a refuge from temperature and flow extremes, competitors, predators, and introduced species; serving as a source of colonists; providing spawning sites and rearing areas; being a rich source of food; and creating migration corridors throughout the landscape. Degradation and loss of headwaters and their connectivity to ecosystems downstream threaten the biological integrity of entire river networks.},

  abstract = {In this article, we demonstrate the application of a continuous confinement metric across entire river networks. Confinement is a useful metric for characterizing and discriminating valley setting. At the reach scale, valley bottom confinement is measured and quantified as the ratio of the length of channel confined on either bank by a confining margin divided by the reach length. The valley bottom is occupied by the contemporary floodplain and/or its channel(s); confining margins can be any landform or feature that makes up the valley bottom margin, such as bedrock hillslopes, terraces, fans, or anthropogenic features such as stopbanks or constructed levees. To test the reliability of calculating confinement across entire networks, we applied our geoprocessing scripts across four physiographically distinct watersheds of the Pacific Northwest, USA using freely available national datasets. Comparison of manually digitized and mapped with modeled calculations of confinement revealed that roughly one-third of reaches were equivalent and about two-thirds of the sites differ by less than {$\pm$}15\%. A sensitivity analysis found that a 500 m reach segmentation length produced reasonable agreement with manual, categorical, expert-derived analysis of confinement. Confinement accuracy can be improved (c. 4\% to 17\% gains) using a more accurately mapped valley bottom and channel position (i.e. with higher-resolution model inputs). This is particularly important when differentiating rivers in the partly confined valley setting. However, at the watershed scale, patterns derived from mapping confinement are not fundamentally different, making this a reasonably accurate and rapid technique for analysis and measurement of confinement across broad spatial extents. {\textcopyright} 2019 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Two decades since calls for stream restoration projects to be scientifically assessed, most projects are still unevaluated, and conducted evaluations yield ambiguous results. Even after these decades of investigation, do we know how to define and measure success? We systematically reviewed 26 studies of stream restoration projects that used macroinvertebrate indicators to assess the success of habitat heterogeneity restoration projects. All 26 studies were previously included in two meta-analyses that sought to assess whether restoration programs were succeeding. By contrast, our review focuses on the evaluations themselves, and asks what exactly we are measuring and learning from these evaluations. All 26 studies used taxonomic diversity, richness, or abundance of invertebrates as biological measures of success, but none presented explicit arguments why those metrics were relevant measures of success for the restoration projects. Although changes in biodiversity may reflect overall ecological condition at the regional or global scale, in the context of reach-scale habitat restoration, more abundance and diversity may not necessarily be better. While all 26 studies sought to evaluate the biotic response to habitat heterogeneity enhancement projects, about half of the studies (46\%) explicitly measured habitat alteration, and 31\% used visual estimates of grain size or subjectively judged `habitat quality' from protocols ill-suited for the purpose. Although the goal of all 26 projects was to increase habitat heterogeneity, 31\% of the studies either sampled only riffles or did not specify the habitats sampled. One-third of the studies (35\%) used reference ecosystems to define target conditions. After 20 years of stream restoration evaluation, more work remains for the restoration community to identify appropriate measures of success and to coordinate monitoring so that evaluations are at a scale capable of detecting ecosystem change.},

  abstract = {Rivers have been diminished, simplified, and degraded globally by the concentration of agriculture, trans\- portation, and development in valley bottoms over decades and centuries, substantially limiting their ecological health and value. More recently, climate change is steadily increasing stress on aging traditional, gray infra\- structure. Recent trends in river management present an opportunity to address both the ecological degradation and climate stress. A strategic focus on riverscapes as critical natural infrastructure can serve as ecosystem-based adaptation to improve resilience to climate change and restore river ecosystem health. As traditional, gray infrastructure ages and fails under increasing climate stress, there is opportunity to rebuild with improved un\- derstanding of the value of the ecosystem services that healthy riverscapes provide. River valley bottoms, including source-water wetlands and riverscape floodplains, are the critical natural infrastructure areas deserving of protection and restoration to build resilience to increased frequency and severity of fires, floods and droughts associated with climate change. Since healthy riverscapes need space and water, the long-standing focus on restoring natural flow regimes makes sense. Equally crucial to restoring river health is to give rivers space and freedom to exercise (i.e., flood and adjust their channels).},

  abstract = {The habitat requirements of fish in streams are in many ways similar to those of humans in our own environment. Fish need a place to live and reproduce, oxygen, tolerable temperatures, food, and clean water free of excess sediment or pollutants. The existence of good fish habitat is dependent on a number of factors, such as geology , climate, water flow, the absence of barriers to upstream or downstream movement, habitat structure (pools, riffles, shelter), water quality, the presence of sufficient food, and the lack of excessive numbers of predators and competitors. This publication provides information on how these factors affect fish, with particular attention given to anadromous salmonids. Salmonids are fish in the taxonomic family Salmonidae, including the many species of salmon and trout (Moyle and Cech 2000). Salmonids present in California include Chinook, coho, chum, pink, and kokanee salmon, steel-head, char, rainbow trout, brook trout, and brown trout. Anadromous refers to fish that are born in fresh water, migrate to the sea where they grow and mature, and then return to fresh water to spawn.},

  abstract = {In this study, we assessed the restoration of a riparian wetland in a moderately incised glacial till valley of the Midwest where drainage pipes were either removed or disabled in 2000 and 2004. The study determined whether wetland hydrology was restored at the site and whether former drainage pipe locations still influenced wetland hydrology after restoration ended. Water table level measurements in 2004 and 2005 indicate that wetland hydrology has been restored in areas of the riparian zone with poorly drained loamy soil. These areas are characterized by an average water table depth of 10 cm below ground surface (BGS) for approximately six months of the year and a water level above 30 cm BGS for at least 14 consecutive days during the growing season. High-resolution water table measurements during and after precipitation events did not indicate that former drainage pipe locations affect the hydrology of the site either by allowing a quick water table drawdown or by acting as preferential conduits for groundwater during precipitation events. Overall, data indicate that wetland hydrology was restored and that the technique of cutting the drainage pipes into several sections or removing them by hand and compacting the disturbed soil back into place without adding any extra material was an appropriate restoration technique for this site.}

While the concept of process-based restoration in riverscapes has been advocated for at least two decades, details and specific examples on how to implement it remain sparse. Here, we describe `low-tech process-based restoration' (LT-PBR) as a practice of using simple, low unit-cost, structural additions (e.g. wood and beaver dams) to riverscapes to mimic functions and initiate specific processes. Hallmarks of this approach include: - An explicit focus on the processes that a low-tech restoration intervention is meant to promote - A conscious effort to use cost-effective, low-tech treatments (e.g. hand-built, natural materials, non-engineered, short-term design life-spans) because of the need to efficiently scale-up application. - `Letting the system do the work' which defers critical decision making to riverscapes and nature's ecosystem engineers.

  abstract = {River-wetland corridors form where a high degree of connectivity between the surface (rheic) and subsurface (hyporheic) components of streamflow creates an interconnected system of channels, wetlands, ponds, and lakes. River-wetland corridors occur where the valley floor is sufficiently wide to accommodate a laterally unconfined river planform that may feature morphologically complex, multi-threaded channels with vegetated bars, islands, and floodplains. River-wetland corridors can develop anywhere there is valley expansion along a drainage network, from the headwaters to estuaries or deltas, and they are found across all latitudes and within all biomes and hydroclimates. River-wetland corridors may be longitudinally continuous but are commonly interspersed with singlethread reaches in narrower portions of the valley. The development and persistence of river-wetland corridors is driven by combinations of geologic, biotic, and geomorphic processes that create a river environment that is diverse, heterogeneous, patchy, and dynamically stable, and within which patterns of flow, sediment features, and habitats shift continually. Hence, we describe these polydimensional river corridors as ``kaleidoscope rivers.'' Historically, river-wetland corridors were pervasive in wide, alluvial valley reaches, but their presence has been so diminished worldwide (due to a diverse range of anthropogenic activities and impacts) that the general public and even most river managers are unaware of their former pervasiveness. Here, we define river-wetland corridors as a river type; review paleoenvironmental and historical records to establish their past ubiquity; describe the geologic, biotic, and geomorphic processes responsible for their formation and persistence; and provide examples of river-wetland corridor remnants that still survive. We close by highlighting the significance of the diverse river functions supported by river-wetland corridors, the consequences of diminution and neglect of this river type, and the implications for river restoration.},
